Most babies develop the skill to roll over between 4 and 7 months.vishnu1$the 6 motor milestones are Motor milestones: How do babies develop during the first two ...
(1) sitting up without support; (2) crawling on hands and knees; (3) standing with assistance; (4) walking with assistance; (5) standing without support; and (6) walking without support.
When do babies sit up?
Babies must be able to hold their heads up without support and have enough upper body strength before being able to sit up on their own. Babies often can hold their heads up around 2 months, and begin to push up with their arms while lying on their stomachs.vishnu1$At 4 months, a baby typically can hold his/her head steady without support, and at 6 months, he/she begins to sit with a little help. At 9 months he/she sits well without support, and gets in and out of a sitting position but may require help. At 12 months, he/she gets into the sitting position without help.
Tummy time helps strengthen the upper body and neck muscles that your baby needs to sit up. Around 6 months, encourage sitting up by helping your baby to sit or support him/her with pillows to allow him/herher to look around.
When do babies roll over?vishnu1$When do babies roll over?
Babies start rolling over as early as 4 months old. They will rock from side to side, a motion that is the foundation for rolling over. They may also roll over from tummy to back. At 6 months old, babies will typically roll over in both directions. It’s common for babies to roll over from tummy to back for a month or two before rolling over from their back to front.
To encourage rolling over, place your baby on a blanket on the floor with a toy or book to one side near him/her to reach toward with his/her arms.

When do babies crawl?
At 6 months old, babies will rock back and forth on hands and knees. This is a building block to crawling. As the child rocks, he may start to crawl backward before moving forward. By 9 months old, babies typically creep and crawl. Some babies do a commando-type crawl, pulling themselves along the floor by their arms.vishnu1$To encourage a child’s crawling development, allow your baby to play on the floor in a safe area away from stairs. Place favorite toys just out of reach as the baby is rocking back and forth. Encourage him/her to reach for his/her toy.
As your baby becomes more mobile, it’s important to childproof your home. Lock up household cleaning, laundry, lawn care and car care products. Use safety gates and lock doors to outside and the basement.vishnu1$Your baby learning to walk can be some of the most exciting and memorable moments of parenthood. From a very young age, your baby strengthens their muscles, slowly preparing to take their first steps. Usually between 6 and 13 months, your baby will crawl. Between 9 and 12 months, they’ll pull themselves up. And between 8 and 18 months, they’ll walk for the first time.
How Babies Develop Walking Skillsvishnu1$How Babies Develop Walking Skills
Your baby will develop many skills, including balance, coordination, standing up and supporting their body weight from one leg to the other. Each new skill will build upon the previous skills, making them more prepared to start walking.
Watching your baby take their first steps on their own is an experience you'll never forget.  When your baby does start walking, it happens in stages, which include these big milestones:
6 months. Babies start to sit up on their own.
6-9 months. Babies start crawling.vishnu1$6 months. Babies start to sit up on their own.
6-9 months. Babies start crawling.
9 months. Babies begin to pull themselves up on furniture like the couch or coffee table, so they can stand.
9-12 months. Babies may start to stand up, hold onto furniture and explore the room.
11-13 months. During this exciting time, you can expect to see your baby start to walk on their own.
Keep in mind that each baby is different and may start walking earlier or later than when the experts deem is "normal". There can be a lot of variation among children's development, and that's totally normal.vishnu1$If your baby is 18 months or older and hasn’t started walking yet, or if you’re concerned about your child’s development, contact your pediatrician.

Baby walkers. Medical professionals do not recommend using baby walkers. Because a walker makes it easy for your baby to get around, your baby’s leg muscles may not develop properly. Also, when a baby is propped up on a baby walker, it can be easier for them to get into things they normally wouldn’t be able to reach, like hot items or poisons that could be dangerous. This makes baby walkers even less safe.vishnu1$Baby shoes. Hold off on buying baby shoes right away. Walking barefoot helps your child to develop improved balance and coordination. Wait until they start walking outside regularly until you introduce them to baby shoes.
What’s Next After Your Baby Starts Walking?
Your baby's first steps are only the beginning of an exciting new phase in their life. Here's what else you can expect as they become a toddler:
14 months: At this age, your toddler will likely be able to stand on their own, squat, stand back up, and maybe even walk backwards.vishnu1$14 months: At this age, your toddler will likely be able to stand on their own, squat, stand back up, and maybe even walk backwards.
15 months: Your child will be pretty good at walking and will likely enjoy push-and-pull toys and exploring new things.
16 months: Your baby will start to show an interest in going up and down the stairs, although they will likely still look to you for help with this one.
18 months: By 18 months, your child will probably have the walking thing down and enjoy moving around on their own. They’ll probably enjoy climbing on furniture and dancing to music, too.vishnu1$At first, an infant is content to lie in his crib and just wiggle his little limbs all over.But baby's abilities don't develop overnight. She'll put a lot of hard work and patience into mastering these motor skills. And as her muscles continue to grow and develop, your little explorer will be spurred by the curiosity to investigate every corner of her room and eventually the whole house. So it's never too early to begin babyproofing.
Heads Upvishnu1$Baby's quest to gain control begins from the head down. The development of your infant's neck muscles is the first big step in her overall body control. In the first few weeks, your newborn's neck may seem floppy. But if you place baby on her stomach, she'll practice lifting her head for a few moments at a time -- even when she's just a few weeks old. Around the 3-month mark, baby will begin to turn her head from side to side to look at you or a colorful toy. These movements help strengthen baby's neck muscles. By 4 months, your little one should be able to hold up her head while she supports herself on her elbows.vishnu1$Roll with Itvishnu1$Once baby can lift her head while on her stomach, she's almost ready to roll. By her fifth month, your little one will use her arms to push off, and with some effort she'll start to roll from her stomach to her side. Tummy-to-side rolling is common for babies because they can use their arms and legs to gain momentum.By 6 months, most babies have gained enough abdominal strength to flip all the way over. Your baby may spend hours flopping from belly to back to belly again. She may even roll across the room as a way to travel. Baby's rolling abilities can be stronger than you think -- so don't forget to keep a firm hold on her, especially on the changing table.vishnu1$A recent study found that babies born in the summer and fall tend to crawl later than those born in the winter and spring. The reason? Summer and fall babies reach crawling age in winter, when they wear more restrictive clothing.vishnu1$For many babies, crawling is a skill that's usually mastered between 7 and 10 months. With a little time and practice, baby will discover that by digging in with his knees and pushing off, he can propel himself across the room toward the target of his choice. And don't worry if he doesn't crawl -- some babies never crawl and instead move straight from sitting up to standing. This is normal.
Sitting Prettyvishnu1$Sitting up usually happens a little later than rolling -- between 6 and 8 months. Though your baby uses the same muscle groups to achieve both of these goals, figuring out how to get upright takes more coordination. If he's feeling unsure, you may also start to see your baby "tripod," leaning forward as he extends his arms to balance his upper body.By his eighth month, your baby may be sitting without your support. Though he might topple over from time to time, he'll begin to catch himself with his arms. And as the muscles in his torso grow stronger, he'll start learning to pick up toys without your help. As the months pass, he'll begin to hold his back and head straighter. As your baby's confidence grows, he'll use his hands less for support -- and more for mischievous play!vishnu1$Crawling Styles
Crawling methods can come in as many varieties as babies themselves. Many babies try several methods before they find the one they like. Below are the most common:
The Combat Crawl: With her forearms flat on the floor and her bottom in the air, baby creeps on her belly.
The Butt Scoot crawl:Baby sits on his tush and propels himself with his arms and legs.
The Bear Walk crawl : Instead of bending her elbows or putting weight on her knees, baby keeps her arms and legs straight, lumbering along.
The Bunny Hop crawl: Getting down on all fours, baby hops.vishnu1$The Bear Walk crawl : Instead of bending her elbows or putting weight on her knees, baby keeps her arms and legs straight, lumbering along.
The Bunny Hop crawl: Getting down on all fours, baby hops.
The Crab crawl: Tucking one knee in and extending the other, baby maneuvers himself sideways and backwards.
Cruise Controlvishnu1$Cruise Control
Although crawling makes a huge difference in how your baby sees the world, don't expect her to be content for long. Soon she will yearn to stand. Keep in mind that when baby starts standing, she may not know how to get down.If she cries for help, show her how to gently bend her knees and lower herself to the floor. Once she feels secure in standing, baby may try to get around by cruising -- traveling up and down the length of the couch or along the wall. She'll also enjoy taking strolls with you while you clutch her hands to keep her upright.
Stepping Outvishnu1$Stepping Out
As baby's balance improves, she'll occasionally let go of you to take a step by herself, only to grab you again when she feels like she may be falling. This independence will grow as baby becomes more confident.Most babies begin to walk between 8 and 18 months, so don't worry if she's taking her time. Though baby's first steps may be shaky and sporadic, soon you won't be able to keep up with her.
Walking Factvishnu1$Walking Fact
Skip the shoes! When baby is first learning to walk, bare feet are best: They allow her to gain balance and grip the ground. But for outdoor treks, try "first walkers" -- lightweight shoes made of natural materials.

Around 6 months, you can start offering your baby a little bit of water (4-8 oz/day, 0.5-1 cup/day) in an open, sippy, or strawed cup. This helps develop cup drinking skills and familiarity with water.A 6-12 month old baby needs two to eight ounces of water per day on top of the water they get from breast milk/formula.

While drinking only water and plain milk is the ideal, we know young children may be exposed to any number of other drinks at some point.
Here's why most of these other drinks should be avoided,vishnu1$100% juice: it's very sweet tasting and lacks fiber, an important nutrient found in whole fruit. Once children are exposed to juice, it may be difficult to limit portions or get them to prefer plain water. In some cases where whole fruit is not available, giving your child a small amount of 100% juice (no more than 4 ounces per day in 2-3 year-olds and no more than 4 to 6 ounces in 4-5 year-olds) can provide some nutritional benefit. However, infants less than 1 year of age should not drink juice. Eating fruit is always preferred to drinking juice.vishnu1$Flavored milk. Chocolate, strawberry, and other flavored milks contain added sugars. Added sugars should be avoided in children less than 2 years of age. Children aged 2-5 also should avoid flavored milk to minimize added sugars intake and avoid developing a preference for sweet tastes. An early preference for flavored milk may make it more difficult to get them to accept regular milk.vishnu1$Plant-based 'milk.' For some children, a dairy allergy or milk intolerance may make it difficult to drink cow's milk. But keep in mind, most plant-based milks are not nutritionally-equivalent to cow's milk and may be lacking in important nutrients such as protein, vitamin D, and calcium. Other than soy milk, plant-based milks are not recommended for children to drink in place of dairy milk. Soy milk is nutritionally equivalent to cow's milk and is an acceptable alternative.vishnu1$Stevia- or artificially-sweetened drinks. The health risks of stevia or artificial sweeteners to children are not well understood. For this reason, it is best to avoid sweetened drinks, even if they are calorie-free. When children have a strong preference for sweet drinks, it can lead them to dislike or refuse plain water.vishnu1$Toddler milk. Toddler milks, often marketed by formula companies as "transitional" to wean from breast milk or formula, are unnecessary and potentially harmful to young children. These products contain added sugars and may fill a baby's stomach up so he or she is not hungry for healthier foods.
Sugary drinks. Sugary drinks like sodas, sports drinks, fruit drinks, lemonade, sweetened water, and other drinks containing added sugars are harmful to a child's health. They increase the risk of excess weight gain, dental cavities, heart disease, diabetes, and fatty liver disease.vishnu1$Caffeinated drinks. Caffeine in young children increases the risk of poor sleep, irritability, nervousness, headaches, and difficulty concentrating. All caffeine-containing beverages are best avoided.vishnu1$There is a general opinion that infants must complete one month of their life before they get a massage. The reason for this is that a baby’s skin barrier is underdeveloped at birth, and it takes 15 days for the skin to become water-resistant.At about 15 days of age, babies shed their umbilical cord stub. Until then, it can be an infection hazard if any massage oil gets trapped in it. If you plan to take your baby to group massage sessions, then it is advised to wait until the baby is six weeks old since very young babies can find crowded environments stressful.Overall, one month is the ideal age since it has multiple benefits: the umbilical cord stub would have fallen, and navel had dried, the skin is less sensitive than at birth, the skin barrier is stronger, and the baby at this age can be more responsive to touch.vishnu1$Tips To Safely Massage Your Baby : 
If the baby becomes cranky during a massage, skip the step or stop the massage.
Be gentle and avoid applying too much pressure on the baby's delicate bones and tissues.
Avoid massaging the genitals or groin area.
Speak, laugh, smile during the massage, and make eye contact with the baby.
Wipe away oil on the baby's palms and fingers after the massage to prevent accidental ingestion.
Maintain a fixed time for the massage to establish a routine for the baby.

Massage provides several natural benefits to the baby, such as:
1) Relieves stress, relaxes muscles: Massage relieves stress in babies by stimulating the release of oxytocin, a feel-good neurohormonei, and decreases the levels of cortisol, a stress hormone (4). It relaxes muscles, stimulates their growth, and even works particularly great with colicky babies.vishnu1$2) Stimulates nervous system: Massage is beneficial to the baby’s nervous system since it greatly improves the baby’s motor skills development.
Helps baby sleep better: Babies sleep better when they are massaged. This has several benefits from faster muscle gain to improved immune response. Infants who are massaged just before bedtime produced more melatonin – a sleep-regulating hormone.vishnu1$3) May improve the quality of life for differently-abled babies: Massage could be a way to soothe babies with Down’s syndromei or cerebral palsyi (2). Premature babies show better motor development when massaged regularly. They even gain weight faster than premature babies that are never massaged.
4) Could help improve blood circulation: Massage improves the blood circulation and also decreases the level of discomfort caused by gas or acidity, congestion, and teething (6). Massage stimulates the nerves that pass through the digestive tract, thus benefiting the digestive system.vishnu1$5) Way to deal with postnatal depression: Massage could be an effective way to deal with postnatal depression among mothers. Depressed mothers showed improved mood and behavior when they massaged their babies regularly.
6) Boosts psychological and social development: According to a 2012 report by Asian Nursing Research Journal (8), stimulation of the baby’s sense of touch has a positive effect on the baby’s psychological and social development along with strengthening the baby’s bond with the parent.vishnu1$The best time to massage a baby is when they are alert, well-rested, and seem interested in the environment. Select a moment right between two feeding sessions when the baby is less likely to feel full or hungry. There should be a gap of at least 45 minutes from the baby’s last feeding session. Also, wait for 15 minutes after the massage before feeding again to give the baby’s body some extra time to relax completely.When it comes to a specific time for massage, you can stick to massage after a bath, when the baby is just about to be tucked into the bed for the night or for a nap. Baby massage before a bath is the ideal since you can wash away the oil during the bath to prevent the accumulation of residual oil or lotion on the baby’s sensitive skin. You may choose to massage your baby after bath in case they have extremely dry skin or if your pediatrician has given a green signal to it. Generally, you’ll notice the greatest benefit if you can stick to a regular bedtime routine of massaging the baby at night.vishnu1$The UK NHS does not recommend using oil or lotion for massaging the baby until they turn one month old (9). This is done to avoid moisture loss from the baby’s skin, which is very delicate at the time of birth. However, during the first month (or longer in case of a premature baby), your baby’s skin develops its natural protective barrier. Owing to this, the baby’s skin becomes relatively thick. This is the time, under the consultation of a pediatrician, when you could start massaging your baby.For babies over one month, you may use any odorless and edible oil so that there may not be a problem even if the oil is ingested by mistake. Consult your pediatrician to know about the most suitable oil for your baby.vishnu1$How To Massage A Baby?
There are no set guidelines on specific steps of massaging. But before you get down to the process of massaging the baby, you need to set up various things.
Setup For Massage
Start your baby massage with the following setup:
Sit on a bed or soft carpeted floor with a towel in front of you. You can also place a towel on a table to massage your little one while you stand. The towel helps absorb excess oil.vishnu1$Sit on a bed or soft carpeted floor with a towel in front of you. You can also place a towel on a table to massage your little one while you stand.

Maintain a comfortable room temperature. During winters, ensure that the room is warm and during summers make sure there is ample circulation of cool and fresh air in the room. Babies do feel warm quickly and tend to become cranky.
Lighting in the room is important and use as much natural light as possible.vishnu1$Lighting in the room is important and use as much natural light as possible.
Choose a massage oil that is specifically made for babies. Select unscented oils, with natural fragrances and no added perfumes.
You can choose to massage your baby with or without the nappy, but you can loosen it when massaging his tummy. Massaging without nappy may increase the risk of accidental soiling, but it also ensures that you massage every part of the baby’s body.
Let’s now see how to massage a baby in the right way. Here is a step-by-step guide:
Step 1: Seeking the permissionvishnu1$Step 1: Seeking the permission
The first step is to take your baby’s ‘permission’ since you would not like to give them a massage when they are not interested. The simple way to do this is by taking some oil in your palms and rubbing it gently on the baby’s tummy and behind the ears and observe their body language. If the baby resists being touched or grumbles and cries when massaging, then it is probably not the right time yet. If the baby shows positive signs and seems okay with what you are doing, then you can go ahead with the massage.vishnu1$Keep in mind that, initially, your baby may seem uncomfortable with the massage as it is a new experience. But as they get used to it, resistance is less likely, and the baby may start to enjoy it.

Step 2: Massaging the legs
Start with the baby’s feet. Rub some drops of oil on your palms and begin massaging the baby’s soles. Massage the heels up to the toes with your thumbs. Then, using your palm, stroke the bottom and top of the baby’s foot. Slowly, make circles with your thumb all over the bottom of each foot and then to the toes. Do not pull any toe like they do in adult foot massage. Instead, lightly massage each toe right to the tip. This will help stimulate nerve endings.vishnu1$Lift one of the legs and make gentle strokes on the ankle and slowly extend it towards the thighs. Gently stroke from the foot up to the thigh. You can also massage both legs at once if your baby is calm and relaxed.
You end the leg massage by gently grasping the thighs with both your hands. Slowly stroke toward the heart from foot to thigh.
Step 3: Moving to the armsvishnu1$You end the leg massage by gently grasping the thighs with both your hands. Slowly stroke toward the heart from foot to thigh.
Step 3: Moving to the arms 
After the legs have been massaged, the arms should be massaged. The pattern of massaging is quite similar to that of the legs. Hold the baby’s hands and make circular strokes on the palms. Slowly make small strokes on the baby’s fingers, moving towards the tips of the fingers.vishnu1$Turn the baby’s hand around and now gently massage the back of the hand with straight strokes towards the wrist. Then, gently massage the wrists in a circular motion, like putting on bangles.
Move your strokes slowly towards the forearm and then towards the upper arm. Massage the entire arm with gentle circular motions as if you are wringing a towel.

Make gentle strokes in tandem from the left and right shoulder towards the chest of the baby. You can then trace your hand back to the shoulder. Repeat the motion gently. Next, place both your hands at the center of your baby’s chest and rub outwards from the body – towards the lateral side.
Make gentle strokes outwards from the bottom of the sternum, the chest bone, across the chest, as if tracing the shape of the heart.

Next comes the baby’s stomach. Remember, this is a delicate area, and therefore you must avoid even the slightest of pressures. You start your stroke from the top of the belly right below the chest bone. Place your palm gently below the chest bone and make clockwise circular strokes across the belly – all around the belly button. Do not apply any pressure and let your hand gently glide across the belly.vishnu1$Continue the circular motions in a clockwise direction while avoiding the belly button. In young babies, the belly button/navel can be sensitive and delicate since they would have recently shed their umbilical cord stub.
Step 6: Massaging face and headvishnu1$Step 6: Massaging face and head
Massaging the face and head can be challenging since babies tend to move a lot. But it is as important as massaging the other parts of the body. Begin by placing the tip of your index finger at the center of your baby’s forehead and slowly stroking along the outline of the face towards the chin. From the chin, move your finger towards the cheeks and massage the cheeks gently in a circular motion. Repeat the strokes a few times.vishnu1$After massaging the face, start massaging the scalp with the fingertip like you are shampooing the baby’s hair. Use gentle pressure from your fingertip and do not apply any extra pressure since the baby’s skull is delicate.
You can even massage the baby’s forehead gently by moving your fingers outwards from the center of the forehead.

Apart from the above-mentioned baby massage techniques, there are a few other effective massages for the baby that work great in certain situations or conditions.
Conditions Where A Massage May Be Beneficial
There could be certain medical conditions or situations where a baby can gain relief through massages. Here are some scenarios where you can consider massaging your baby to make them feel better.vishnu1$There could be certain medical conditions or situations where a baby can gain relief through massages. Here are some scenarios where you can consider massaging your baby to make them feel better.
1. Constipation, gas, and colic
The ‘I love you’ massage is a suitable massage to give when your baby is suffering from constipation, gas, or is colici. Research proves that infant massage could work great in easing the symptoms of colic among babies (10).vishnu1$This is a variation of the standard tummy massage that can help tackle multiple problems. Start by placing the baby on their back. Use your fingers to trace a straight line on the right side of the navel. This forms the letter ‘I’. Then, place your fingers at the upper left corner of the belly to trace a horizontal stroke towards the end of the left ribcage.vishnu1$Trace a vertical straight-line stroke, exactly like the ‘I’ stroke. This forms the letter ‘L’. Next, place your fingers at the lower-left corner of the belly and trace a letter ‘U’ around the navel towards the baby’s lower-left corner of the tummy.
This massage helps your baby poop well and could provide relief from gas-related pain. It is also a suitable tummy ache massage for babies since the pattern of the letters in the massage follows the layout of the intestines within. It stimulates the intestines to ease gas and constipation (11), which could cause pain and discomfort to the baby.vishnu1$2. Cough and congestion
Massage could also help the baby feel better when they are suffering from congestion, cough, and cold. Here are the steps to follow:
Step 1: Start by rubbing some oil or lotion on the palm of your hand. This makes your hands warm, soothing the baby as you massage. Rub your baby’s chest using both your hands by starting from the center to the outside using small circular strokes. Then rub the entire chest in circular motions using just one hand.vishnu1$Step 2: Now, focus on the baby’s face. Here, you massage the sinuses by gently running your fingertips from the inner end of the eyebrow down to the nose and then to the cheek. Repeat this motion a couple of times. This could help release any accumulated mucus present in the sinuses.
Step 3: Lastly, you massage the baby’s feet, focusing primarily on the sole. Massaging the sole could help in generating heat that can help loosen mucus within the chest.
The feeling of warmth could relieve the heavy feeling of congestion in the chest caused by cold and repeated cough.
3. Gastroesophageal refluxvishnu1$The feeling of warmth could relieve the heavy feeling of congestion in the chest caused by cold and repeated cough.
3. Gastroesophageal reflux
If your baby has acid reflux, then they may have trouble lying flat on the ground. In such situations, place a pillow under their upper back. Place the pillow in a manner that the baby lies at a 45-degree angle. Then give the baby a tummy massage with the same steps mentioned above. Regular massages in a baby with chronic reflux has been clinically proven to reduce the symptoms and give the baby relief (12).
4. Hiccupsvishnu1$4. Hiccups
Massage could be helpful when your baby is having bouts of hiccups. Hiccups occur when the irritated nerves of the abdominal cavity cause fluttering of the diaphragm due to accumulated gas or due to excessive intake of air during breastfeeding. A massage could help de-stress the tensed diaphragm, thus mitigating hiccups.vishnu1$When massaging to rid your baby off hiccups, put the baby in an upright position, and massage the baby from the lower back all the way to the shoulders in gentle circular motions. You can do this by placing the baby on their tummy. Do not apply a lot of pressure while massaging.
5. Jaundicevishnu1$5. Jaundice
Post consulting your pediatrician, you can follow the aforementioned massage procedure if the baby is suffering from jaundice. Body massage for jaundiced babies has been clinically proven to improve the defecation rate and reduce the amount of bilirubin, which is the compound that causes yellowish skin in jaundice (13). Massage, however, does not cure jaundice in babies. It just alleviates the symptoms and associated discomfort caused by jaundice, thus making the baby feel better.
6. Vaccinations

It may sound surprising, but local massage after vaccination in infants could have significant benefits for the little one. Firstly, massaging the area around the point of injection can help relieve pain and make the baby feel better. Secondly, it helps improve the immunogenicity of some vaccines, which is the body’s ability to produce antibodies against the antigen for which the vaccine has been given. This case has been clinically proven for the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine (14).vishnu1$Never massage directly at the point where the vaccine was injected. Instead, focus on the surrounding areas by massaging gently with soft and smooth strokes.
7. Teething
Massaging your baby’s gums when the baby is teething is a good way of alleviating the pain and irritation (15). Simply wash your hands thoroughly and wipe them dry. Then use your clean fingers to massage the bottom of their gums gently. Do not apply any pressure nor massage the top of the gums where the tooth would erupt. Only run your fingers gently at the base of the gums and continue doing so all along the gums.vishnu1$Focus on the gums at the front since that is where the first teeth would emerge. You can try this massage when you feel your baby is irritated due to teething.
How Often Should You Massage Your Baby?
There is no restriction on how less or more you can massage your baby. It is great, though, to have a fixed massage routine since it helps your baby reap all the long-term benefits of massage. If your baby faces certain adverse medical problems, then consult the baby’s doctor about the ideal massage routine.

Although olive oil, ghee and mustard oil have been used safely by families for massaging their babies for many years, research suggests that these oils, which are high in oleic acid, may damage the skin barrier if they are left on the skin. This is more likely to be the case if your baby already has dry, sensitive skin or eczema.

Choose your words. Decide which words you're going to use for your child's bodily fluids. Avoid negative words, such as dirty or stinky.vishnu1$Choose your words. Decide which words you're going to use for your child's bodily fluids. Avoid negative words, such as dirty or stinky.
Prepare the equipment. Place a potty chair in the bathroom or, initially, wherever your child is spending most of his or her time. Encourage your child to sit on the potty chair in clothes to start out. Make sure your child's feet rest on the floor or a stool. Use simple, positive terms to talk about the toilet. You might dump the contents of a dirty diaper into the potty chair and toilet to show their purpose. Have your child flush the toilet.vishnu1$Schedule potty breaks. Have your child sit on the potty chair or toilet without a diaper for a few minutes at two-hour intervals, as well as first thing in the morning and right after naps. For boys, it's often best to master urination sitting down, and then move to standing up after bowel training is complete. Stay with your child and read a book together or play with a toy while he or she sits. Allow your child to get up if he or she wants. Even if your child simply sits there, offer praise for trying — and remind your child that he or she can try again later. Bring the potty chair with you when you're away from home with your child.vishnu1$Get there — Fast! When you notice signs that your child might need to use the toilet — such as squirming, squatting or holding the genital area — respond quickly. Help your child become familiar with these signals, stop what he or she is doing, and head to the toilet. Praise your child for telling you when he or she has to go. Keep your child in loose, easy-to-remove clothing.
Explain hygiene. Teach girls to spread their legs and wipe carefully from front to back to prevent bringing germs from the rectum to the vagina or bladder. Make sure your child washes his or her hands afterward.vishnu1$Ditch the diapers. After a couple of weeks of successful potty breaks and remaining dry during the day, your child might be ready to trade diapers for training pants or underwear. Celebrate the transition. Let your child return to diapers if he or she is unable to remain dry. Consider using a sticker or star chart for positive reinforcement.vishnu1$If your child resists using the potty chair or toilet or isn't getting the hang of it within a few weeks, take a break. Chances are he or she isn't ready yet. Pushing your child when he or she isn't ready can lead to a frustrating power struggle. Try again in a few months.
Nighttime training
Nap time and nighttime training typically takes longer to achieve. Most children can stay dry at night between ages 5 and 7. In the meantime, use disposable training pants and mattress covers when your child sleeps.
Accidents will happen

To handle accidents:
Stay calm. Don't scold, discipline or shame your child. You might say, "You forgot this time. Next time you'll get to the bathroom sooner."
Be prepared. Keep a change of underwear and clothing handy, especially at school or in child care.
What does your baby’s poop color say about their health?
While your baby may have different poop colors during infancy, it’s important to know what’s considered “normal” and when you should call your child’s pediatrician.vishnu1$While your baby may have different poop colors during infancy, it’s important to know what’s considered “normal” and when you should call your child’s pediatrician.
Below is a breakdown of all the possible changes you may see in your baby’s stool, what these might mean, and how long they may last.
Black
A newborn’s first stool is likely to be black, with a tar-like consistency. This is called meconium, and it contains mucus, skin cells, and amniotic fluid. Black stool should not last more than a couple of days.
Mustard yellowvishnu1$Mustard yellow
Once the meconium passes, a newborn’s stool may be a mustard yellow color. This color of stool is also most common in breastfed or chestfed babies.
Bright yellow
It’s typical to see bright yellow poop in breastfed or chestfed (and sometimes formula-fed) babies. Bright yellow poop that’s much more frequent than usual and extremely runny, though, could be diarrhea. Diarrhea can increase the risk for dehydration.
Orange
Orange poop occurs from pigments picked up in your baby’s digestive tract. It can occur in both breastfed and formula-fed babies.
Redvishnu1$Orange
Orange poop occurs from pigments picked up in your baby’s digestive tract. It can occur in both breastfed and formula-fed babies.
Red
Sometimes your baby’s poop can also turn red from dark red foods and drinks they have consumed, such as tomato juice or beets. Red poop could also mean there’s blood in your baby’s bowel movements from an intestinal infection, among other causes, which should be addressed by a pediatrician.vishnu1$Red blood in a baby’s poop can also occur from milk allergies or from an anal fissure. Certain red-colored medications, such as amoxicillin or cefdinir, may also cause red poop.
It’s a good idea to call your child’s pediatrician if your baby has red stool.
If they’ve recently eaten red food, you may consider waiting to see if the next stool returns to its usual color before calling your pediatrician. But don’t wait to see if your baby experiences other symptoms like vomiting or stomach pain before calling the doctor
Greenish tanvishnu1$Greenish tan
Formula-fed babies may have poop that’s a combination of greenish tan and yellow. Their poop is also firmer than that of a breastfed or chestfed baby.
Dark green
Dark green poop is most common in babies who are starting solid foods that are green in color, such as spinach and peas. Iron supplements can also cause your baby’s poop to turn green.
White
White poop can indicate that your baby isn’t producing enough bile in their liver to help them digest food properly. This is a serious concern. White poop at any stage should be addressed by a pediatrician.
Grayvishnu1$Gray
Like white poop, baby stools that are gray in color can mean your baby isn’t digesting food as they should. Call your child’s pediatrician if your baby has poop that’s gray or a chalky consistency.
What does poop texture mean?
Color can indicate quite a bit about your baby’s poop, but it’s also important to consider texture. The combination can tell you a lot about your baby’s health that color alone can’t.
Newborn poop consistencyvishnu1$Newborn poop consistency
Newborn poop has a thick, tar-like consistency. This is standard, and both the color and texture of a newborn’s poop will change within the first couple of days of life.
Talk with your child’s pediatrician if your baby’s poop hasn’t changed to being looser and yellow within a few days of birth. This can be a sign they aren’t getting enough milk.
Breastfed or chestfed consistency
Babies fed breast milk have looser stools that may contain seed-like substances. This doesn’t necessarily mean that your baby has diarrhea.vishnu1$Breastfed or chestfed consistency
Babies fed breast milk have looser stools that may contain seed-like substances. This doesn’t necessarily mean that your baby has diarrhea.
They may have also more bowel movements more frequently because breast milk is digested faster. This is also not considered diarrhea.
Formula-fed consistency
Formula-fed babies tend to have firmer poop that’s tan to brown in color with some green and yellow. Your baby may be constipated if they strain during bowel movements and have infrequent, hard stools.
Weaning stage consistencyvishnu1$Weaning stage consistency
The weaning stage is a transitional phase when you move from solely nursing to feeding baby other types of fluids and solid foods. During this phase, your baby’s poop may become more firm. You may also notice stronger-smelling stools as well.
After introducing solids
Once you’ve introduced solid foods to your baby’s diet, their poop will start to bulk up like typical adult poop.
Constipation consistencyvishnu1$After introducing solids
Once you’ve introduced solid foods to your baby’s diet, their poop will start to bulk up like typical adult poop.
Constipation consistency
Extremely hard poop that’s difficult to pass could mean constipation. Small, pebble-like drops that are dark brown in color are also a sign of this. If your baby is constipated, these remedies may help. But speak with your child’s pediatrician before trying home remedies to relieve baby’s constipation.
Diarrheavishnu1$Diarrhea
Diarrhea in a baby consists of loose, watery stools that occur more than once every feeding. It can be difficult to pinpoint diarrhea in a young infant because their bowel movements are naturally looser than babies who are on solid foods.
Mucus or frothy stool
A mucus-like or frothy texture can sometimes occur when your baby is drooling from teething, then subsequently swallows their drool.
If you see this texture in your baby’s stool and they’re not drooling, it could be caused by an infection that requires pediatric treatment.
What if you see mucus in stool?vishnu1$If you see this texture in your baby’s stool and they’re not drooling, it could be caused by an infection that requires pediatric treatment.
What if you see mucus in stool?
The presence of mucus in the stool is standard in newborns as they pass meconium. It’s also seen in babies who swallow their drool. However, mucus can also be caused by a bacterial infection or other trouble in your baby’s intestines.
As a rule of thumb, you should call your pediatrician if your baby is older than a few days, is not drooling, and has persistent mucus in their stool.
What if you see blood in stool?vishnu1$As a rule of thumb, you should call your pediatrician if your baby is older than a few days, is not drooling, and has persistent mucus in their stool.
What if you see blood in stool?
Blood may be present in a baby’s stool from straining during constipation. It could also be a sign of an infection, which warrants a call to the pediatrician.
Small amounts of blood are sometimes ingested during nursing if your nipples are cracked. This appears as specks of black or dark red in your baby’s poop.
Food pieces in stoolvishnu1$Small amounts of blood are sometimes ingested during nursing if your nipples are cracked. This appears as specks of black or dark red in your baby’s poop.
Food pieces in stool
Once your baby starts solids, you might notice food pieces appearing in their poop. This is because some foods aren’t digestible and will quickly pass through your baby’s system.
How often should babies poop?
It’s OK if your baby doesn’t pass stool every day. This does not necessarily mean there’s a concern. A newborn can have few bowel movements early on.vishnu1$How often should babies poop?
It’s OK if your baby doesn’t pass stool every day. This does not necessarily mean there’s a concern. A newborn can have few bowel movements early on.
If you’re breastfeeding or chestfeeding, your baby may poop only once per week when they get to the 3- to 6-week mark. If your baby is formula-fed, then you should see bowel movements occurring around once per day. Anything less than this could indicate constipation, though some formula-fed babies don’t poop every day, either.vishnu1$Your baby will likely have a daily bowel movement once they’re on solids. Pooping more than once after each feeding at any stage could indicate diarrhea.
Know that changes in color and even consistency are expected during your baby’s first year of life. But it’s also important to monitor these changes in case you need to call your child’s pediatrician.vishnu1$The color of baby poop shifts for various reasons. Feeding and age can also affect the overall color and consistency.If you’re ever concerned about your baby’s bowel movements, call your child’s pediatrician for advice. You should also take your baby to the pediatrician if they have diarrhea accompanied by a fever.Extremely hard and dry stools are usually a sign of constipation. But if your baby is vomiting or otherwise ill, it may be a sign that they are dehydrated. See your child’s pediatrician if you suspect your baby’s dehydrated.
Other symptoms of dehydration in a baby include:vishnu1$Other symptoms of dehydration in a baby include:
fewer than six wet diapers a day, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics
fussiness
mood that’s less playful than usual
crying without tears
excessive fatigue
skin that changes in color or has a wrinkled appearance
sunken soft spot on the head
sunken eyes
Monitoring your baby’s stool can be a useful way to identify health problems that your baby can’t otherwise tell you about.

Babies who are having more than 500ml (about a pint) of infant formula a day should not be given vitamin supplements.vishnu1$The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends infants be fed breast milk (also known as human milk) exclusively for the first 6 months after birth. Human milk contains a natural balance of vitamins, especially C, E and the B vitamins. So, if you and your baby are both healthy, and you are well nourished, your child may not require any supplements of these vitamins. However, breastfed infants need supplemental vitamin D.
Why do babies need vitamin D supplements?vishnu1$Why do babies need vitamin D supplements?
Our bodies need sunlight to produce vitamin D, which is why exposure to sunlight is good in moderation. However, children should wear sunscreen, hats, and protective clothing when outdoors for extended periods of time to prevent sunburn and reduce the risk of skin cancer later in life. For this reason, the AAP recommends that all infants receive a vitamin D supplement (unless they are consuming more than 27 ounces per day of commercial formula that has the vitamin D supplement added.
How much vitamin D do babies need?vishnu1$How much vitamin D do babies need?
Vitamin D supplements of 400 IU (10 mcg) per day are recommended for babies up until age one year, with 600 IU (15 mcg) per day for children over one year. Talk to your pediatrician about supplemental vitamin D drops.
Do babies need iron supplements?vishnu1$Do babies need iron supplements?
For the first four months, your breastfed baby needs no additional iron. The iron in their body at birth was enough for their initial growth. But now the reserves will be low and as their growth increases, so will their need for iron. At four months of age infants who are partially or completely breastfeeding should be supplemented with 1 mg/kg per day of oral iron until appropriate iron-containing complementary foods (including iron-fortified cereals) are introduced in their diet.
Universal screening for iron deficiencyvishnu1$Universal screening for iron deficiency
The AAP recommends that all babies be screened at 12 months of age for iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia.
If there were pregnancy or birth complications such as diabetes, low birth weight, or prematurity, or if your baby was small for gestational age and is taking breast milk, iron supplementation may start in the first month after birth. Fortunately, once you start your baby on solid foods, they’ll also receive iron from meats, iron-fortified cereals and green vegetables.

Whether your baby is born with hair or without hair, know that it's perfectly normal for infants to have problems with hair growth or experience hair loss after delivery. In most cases, hair growth will occur within the first 6 to 12 months.
Baby’s hair at birthvishnu1$There’s no way to predict how much hair a baby will have at birth. Some babies are born with a lot of hair and others are born without hair. Even when a baby has hair at birth, their hair can fall out shortly after delivery, then later regrow.Understand that it’s completely normal for a newborn to have no hair or to have hair loss! It doesn’t indicate an underlying health problem.The color and quantity of a baby’s hair at birth is largely due to genetics. Typically, hair growth occurs at about the 30th week of pregnancy. If your baby starts to grow hair in the womb, they’ll likely be born with hair on their head.Hormones also play a role in the amount of hair a newborn has. Inside the womb, hormone levels are high, which can accelerate hair growth.After delivery, though, hormone levels drop at a fast pace. As a result, a baby’s hair growth slows down.Shortly after birth, a newborn’s hair also enters a new growth cycle. When this occurs, their hair might fall out. The baby then remains bald until their new hair grows in.The bottom line is that there’s no reason to be overly concerned about hair loss. But, understandably, you might be eager for your baby’s hair to grow.vishnu1$If so, here are a few things you can do to grow baby’s hair.vishnu1$1. Apply coconut oil: Coconut oil is rich in natural vitamin E, which is a nutrient with antioxidant properties. It’s not only beneficial to the skin — it can also promote hair growth by improving blood circulation to the scalp.Coconut oil also adds shine to hair and may prevent hair loss.In an older 2003 studyTrusted Source, researchers found coconut oil to be useful on hair when used as a wash or grooming product. When combined with sunflower and mineral oil, it helped reduce hair protein loss.To help stimulate thicker, fuller hair, gently apply coconut oil to your baby’s scalp a few times per week. This doesn’t only moisturize their hair; it can also help eliminate cradle cap.Use organic or extra-virgin coconut oil — it’s unrefined, meaning it hasn’t been processed. Apply a small amount to your baby’s scalp and allow the oil to sit for about 20 minutes. Rinse their scalp with warm water.vishnu1$2. Brush your baby’s scalp: Gently combing, brushing, or massaging baby’s scalp can also stimulate hair growth. This is because regular grooming can loosen cradle cap and remove dry skin.In addition, brushing encourages blood circulation to the scalp and hair follicles. After applying oil, gently massage your baby’s scalp with your fingers for a few minutes.This helps with hair growth and relaxes your baby — so (bonus!) don’t be surprised if they fall asleep.vishnu1$3. Shampoo regularly: You might be nervous to wash your baby’s hair, but regular shampooing keeps their scalp clean and also loosens cradle cap.Once baby is out of the newborn phase (during which you need to bathe them only about once per week), wash their hair every 2 or 3 days. Make sure you use lukewarm water and a gentle baby shampoo.The accumulation of dirt on your baby’s scalp can cause dryness, which can slow hair growth.
4. Use a hair conditioner
The same way you might apply hair conditioner to your hair after shampooing, you can also use conditioner on your baby’s hair.vishnu1$4. Use a hair conditioner
The same way you might apply hair conditioner to your hair after shampooing, you can also use conditioner on your baby’s hair.
Conditioner is a moisturizing agent that replaces moisture stripped away by shampoo. It helps protect and strengthen the hair, which can promote growth and reduce breakage.
Hair conditioner is especially important if your baby has textured or curly hair, which can be prone to dryness. Apply conditioner after shampooing, then rinse the product from your baby’s hair with warm water.vishnu1$Again, choose a kid-friendly conditioner that’s gentle and tear-free.
5. Use a soft towel
When drying your baby’s hair after shampooing and conditioning, be as gentle as possible. Use a soft towel to lightly dry their hair.
Using a hard or rough towel can potentially damage their young hair follicles and slow hair growth.
6. Detangle hair
Keep in mind that textured or curly hair can easily tangle and form knots. These knots can break off, causing your baby to lose hair.
Each day, gently use a soft brush to detangle your baby’s hair.
7. Maintain a healthy dietvishnu1$Each day, gently use a soft brush to detangle your baby’s hair.
7. Maintain a healthy diet
A healthy, balanced diet is crucial to helping your baby grow thicker, fuller hair.
If baby is at least 6 months old and eating solid foods, feed them foods rich in iron, vitamin A, B vitamins, vitamin D, zinc, and protein.
For example, baby-friendly vitamin A foods include:
butternut squash
pumpkin
carrots
mango
Foods rich in B vitamins include:
beans
meat
eggs
whole grains
potatoesvishnu1$For example, baby-friendly vitamin A foods include:
butternut squash
pumpkin
carrots
mango
Foods rich in B vitamins include:
beans
meat
eggs
whole grains
potatoes
Vegetables like leafy greens are rich in iron, which helps carry blood and oxygen to the hair follicles and stimulates growth.
If you’re breastfeeding, it’s important that you maintain a healthy diet, too. Your diet is essential to your baby’s growth and development. The foods you eat can also encourage hair growth.
8. Apply gelatin to your baby’s scalpvishnu1$8. Apply gelatin to your baby’s scalp
Gelatin is an amino acid that can stimulate hair growth when applied to a baby’s scalp.
Mix 1 teaspoon of gelatin powder with water. You can also include a teaspoon of honey and a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar to the mixture.
Honey is an antioxidant that restores nutrients to the hair and scalp. Meanwhile, apple cider vinegar helps promote hair growth.
Apply the gelatin mixture to your baby’s scalp and allow it to sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Rinse out the gelatin and shampoo your baby’s hair as normal.
9. Avoid hair tiesvishnu1$Apply the gelatin mixture to your baby’s scalp and allow it to sit for 10 to 15 minutes. Rinse out the gelatin and shampoo your baby’s hair as normal.
9. Avoid hair ties
If your baby has a few remaining strands of hair, you might be tempted to pull them back into a small ponytail or use a hair clip. But tying your baby’s hair too tight can damage their hair follicles and cause hair loss.
Rather than use a ponytail holder, use a silk headband — it’s gentle on the hair.
10. Give baby a haircutvishnu1$Rather than use a ponytail holder, use a silk headband — it’s gentle on the hair.
10. Give baby a haircut
Some parents hesitate to give their baby a haircut. But if your baby has hair loss or bald spots, a haircut can get rid of patchiness and allow their hair to grow in evenly.
One belief is that a haircut can jump-start hair growth. However, this idea isn’t backed by science.
If you decide to cut your baby’s hair, trim longer strands first. Don’t use a razor — you might accidentally cut your baby’s scalp. Use a hair trimmer instead.vishnu1$If you decide to cut your baby’s hair, trim longer strands first. Don’t use a razor — you might accidentally cut your baby’s scalp. Use a hair trimmer instead.
After cutting baby’s hair, apply a moisturizer to their scalp to reduce dryness.
Whether your baby is born with hair or without hair, know that it’s perfectly normal for infants to have problems with hair growth or experience hair loss after delivery.
In most cases, hair growth will occur within the first 6 to 12 months. But, of course, if you have any concerns, don’t hesitate to contact your doctor with questions.vishnu1$The first hour after birth when a mother has uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact with her newborn is referred to as the “golden hour.” Research has shown that what happens during the first 60 minutes of a baby's life, which is often referred to as the golden hour, can maximize the bonding between mother and child. “The golden hour is very beneficial and critical for even years down the road between both mom and baby.This period of time is critical for a newborn baby who spent the past nine months in a controlled environment.As long as mom and baby are well, immediate and continuous skin-to-skin contact is recommended.vishnu1$The Golden Minute refers to the first 60 s of a newborn's life,7 during which the complex but natural transition from intra- to extrauterine life occurs. Typically, midwives perform newborn assessment during the Golden Minute.
**************************************** C-section ***************************************************************
what is a c-section operation?vishnu1$Cesarean delivery (C-section) is used to deliver a baby through surgical incisions made in the abdomen and uterus.In C-section a 10 to 20cm cut is made in your tummy and womb.Planning for a C-section might be necessary if there are certain pregnancy complications. In C-section a 10 to 20cm cut is made in your tummy and womb – this will usually be a horizontal cut just below your bikini line, although sometimes a vertical cut below your bellybutton may be made. And your baby is delivered through the opening – this usually takes 5 to 10 minutes and you may feel some tugging at this point.A cesarean delivery is a surgery where an incision is made through the abdominal wall to deliver a baby quickly and safely. Cesarean deliveries are sometimes medically necessary, but the recovery time is slightly longer than a vaginal birth.You won't feel any pain during the C-section, although you may feel sensations like pulling and pressure. Most women are awake and simply numbed from the waist down using regional anesthesia (an epidural and/or a spinal block) during a C-section. That way, they are awake to see and hear their baby being born.Is C-section as painful as natural birth? Even though labor and vaginal birth can be hard work, they are generally easier on a woman's body than a cesarean. Recovery after vaginal birth is usually shorter and less painful than after a C-section, and allows the woman to spend more time with her baby.Often, however, the need for a first-time C-section isn' clear until after labor starts.Once the baby is delivered the uterus is closed with a double layer of stitching. Four of the five remaining layers are stitched with a single layer of stitching, but one layer is not restitched as it heals better – with no buckling and reduced chance of scar tissue developing, without restitiching.vishnu1$Health care providers might recommend a C-section if:
Labor isn't progressing normally. Labor that isn't progressing (labor dystocia) is one of the most common reasons for a C-section. Issues with labor progression include prolonged first stage (prolonged dilation or opening of the cervix) or prolonged second stage (prolonged time of pushing after complete cervical dilation).
The baby is in distress. Concern about changes in a baby's heartbeat might make a C-section the safest option.vishnu1$The baby is in distress. Concern about changes in a baby's heartbeat might make a C-section the safest option.
The baby or babies are in an unusual position. A C-section is the safest way to deliver babies whose feet or buttocks enter the birth canal first (breech) or babies whose sides or shoulders come first (transverse).
You're carrying more than one baby. A C-section might be needed for women carrying twins, triplets or more. This is especially true if labor starts too early or the babies are not in a head-down position.vishnu1$There's a problem with the placenta. If the placenta covers the opening of the cervix (placenta previa), a C-section is recommended for delivery.
Prolapsed umbilical cord. A C-section might be recommended if a loop of umbilical cord slips through the cervix in front of the baby.
There's a health concern. A C-section might be recommended for women with certain health issues, such as a heart or brain condition.vishnu1$There's a health concern. A C-section might be recommended for women with certain health issues, such as a heart or brain condition.
There's a blockage. A large fibroid blocking the birth canal, a pelvic fracture or a baby who has a condition that can cause the head to be unusually large (severe hydrocephalus) might be reasons for a C-section.
You've had a previous C-section or other surgery on the uterus. Although it's often possible to have a vaginal birth after a C-section, a health care provider might recommend a repeat C-section.vishnu1$Some women request C-sections with their first babies. They might want to avoid labor or the possible complications of vaginal birth. Or they might want to plan the time of delivery. However, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, this might not be a good option for women who plan to have several children. The more C-sections a woman has, the greater the risk of problems with future pregnancies.
Like other types of major surgery, C-sections carry risks.
Risks to babies include:vishnu1$Like other types of major surgery, C-sections carry risks.
Risks to babies include:
Breathing problems. Babies born by scheduled C-section are more likely to develop a breathing issue that causes them to breathe too fast for a few days after birth (transient tachypnea).
Surgical injury. Although rare, accidental nicks to the baby's skin can occur during surgery.
Risks to mothers include:
Infection. After a C-section, there might be a risk of developing an infection of the lining of the uterus (endometritis), in the urinary tract or at the site of the incision.vishnu1$Infection. After a C-section, there might be a risk of developing an infection of the lining of the uterus (endometritis), in the urinary tract or at the site of the incision.
Blood loss. A C-section might cause heavy bleeding during and after delivery.
Reactions to anesthesia. Reactions to any type of anesthesia are possible.
Blood clots. A C-section might increase the risk of developing a blood clot inside a deep vein, especially in the legs or pelvis (deep vein thrombosis). If a blood clot travels to the lungs and blocks blood flow (pulmonary embolism), the damage can be life-threatening.vishnu1$Surgical injury. Although rare, surgical injuries to the bladder or bowel can occur during a C-section.
Increased risks during future pregnancies. Having a C-section increases the risk of complications in a later pregnancy and in other surgeries. The more C-sections, the higher the risks of placenta previa and a condition in which the placenta becomes attached to the wall of the uterus (placenta accreta).
A C-section also increases the risk of the uterus tearing along the scar line (uterine rupture) for women who attempt a vaginal delivery in a later pregnancy.vishnu1$A C-section also increases the risk of the uterus tearing along the scar line (uterine rupture) for women who attempt a vaginal delivery in a later pregnancy.

A health care provider might also recommend certain blood tests before a C-section. These tests provide information about blood type and the level of the main component of red blood cells (hemoglobin). The test results can be helpful in case you need a blood transfusion during the C-section.vishnu1$Even for a planned vaginal birth, it's important to prepare for the unexpected. Discuss the possibility of a C-section with your health care provider well before your due date.
If you don't plan to have more children, you might talk to your health care provider about long-acting reversible birth control or permanent birth control. A permanent birth control procedure might be performed at the time of the C-section.
A C-section can be done in various ways. But most C-sections involve these steps:vishnu1$A C-section can be done in various ways. But most C-sections involve these steps:
At home. Your health care provider might ask you to shower at home with an antiseptic soap the night before and the morning of your C-section. Don't shave your pubic hair within 24 hours of your C-section. This can increase the risk of a surgical site infection. If your pubic hair needs to be removed, it will be trimmed by the surgical staff just before surgery.vishnu1$At the hospital. Your abdomen will be cleansed. A thin tube (catheter) will likely be placed into your bladder to collect urine. An intravenous line will be placed in a vein in your hand or arm to provide fluid and drugs, including antibiotics to prevent infection.
Anesthesia. Most C-sections are done under regional anesthesia, which numbs only the lower part of your body. This allows you to be awake during the procedure. Common choices include a spinal block and an epidural block.
Some C-sections might require general anesthesia. With general anesthesia, you won't be awake during the birth.vishnu1$Some C-sections might require general anesthesia. With general anesthesia, you won't be awake during the birth.
During the c-section procedure:
A doctor makes surgical incisions in the abdomen and the uterus to deliver the baby.A 10 to 20cm cut is made in your tummy and womb.
Abdominal incision: A 10 to 20cm cut is made in your tummy and womb. The doctor makes an incision in the abdominal wall. It's usually done horizontally near the pubic hairline. Or the doctor might make a vertical incision from just below the navel to just above the pubic bone.vishnu1$Uterine incision. The uterine incision is then made — usually horizontally across the lower part of the uterus (low transverse incision). Other types of uterine incisions might be used depending on the baby's position within the uterus and whether there are complications, such as placenta previa or preterm delivery.
Delivery. The baby will be delivered through the incisions. The doctor clears the baby's mouth and nose of fluids, then clamps and cuts the umbilical cord. The placenta is then removed from the uterus, and the incisions are closed with sutures.vishnu1$If you have regional anesthesia, you're likely to be able to hold the baby shortly after delivery.
After the c-section procedure:
A C-section usually requires a hospital stay for 2 to 3 days. Your health care provider will discuss pain relief options with you.
Once the anesthesia begins to wear off, you'll be encouraged to drink fluids and walk. This helps prevent constipation and deep vein thrombosis. Your health care team will monitor your incision for signs of infection. The bladder catheter will likely be removed as soon as possible.vishnu1$You can start breastfeeding as soon as you're ready, even in the delivery room. Ask your nurse or a lactation consultant to teach you how to position yourself and support your baby so that you're comfortable. Your health care team will select medications for your post-surgical pain with breastfeeding in mind.

During the C-section recovery process, discomfort and fatigue are common. To promote healing:
Take it easy. Rest when possible. Try to keep everything that you and your baby need within reach. For the first few weeks, don't lift more than 25 pounds.
Use recommended pain relief. To soothe incision soreness, your health care provider might recommend a heating pad and pain medications that are safe for breastfeeding women and their babies. These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).vishnu1$Wait to have sex. To prevent infection, wait at least six weeks to have sex and don't put anything in your vagina after your C-section.
Wait to drive. If you're taking narcotics for pain relief, it might take 1 to 2 weeks before you can comfortably apply brakes and twist to check blind spots.
Check your C-section incision for signs of infection. Pay attention to any symptoms. Contact your health care provider if:

If you have severe mood swings, loss of appetite, overwhelming fatigue and lack of joy in life shortly after childbirth, you might have postpartum depression. Contact your health care provider if you think you might be depressed, especially if your symptoms don't go away, you have trouble caring for your baby or completing daily tasks, or you have thoughts of harming yourself or your baby.vishnu1$The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that postpartum care be ongoing. Have contact with your health care provider within three weeks after delivery. Within 12 weeks after delivery, see your health care provider for a postpartum evaluation.vishnu1$During this appointment your health care provider likely will check your mood and emotional well-being, discuss contraception and birth spacing, review information about infant care and feeding, talk about your sleep habits and issues related to fatigue and do a physical exam, including a pap smear if it's due. This might include a check of your abdomen, vagina, cervix and uterus to make sure you're healing well.
What’s a planned C-section?vishnu1$What’s a planned C-section? 
Although cesarean deliveries are common and generally safe, they have more risks than delivering a baby vaginally. For this reason, vaginal births are recommended. But it’s possible to schedule a cesarean delivery in advance for medical reasons.
For example, if your baby is breech and doesn’t change position as your due date approaches, your doctor may schedule a cesarean delivery. Additionally, cesarean deliveries are usually scheduled for the medical reasons listed below.vishnu1$It’s also possible to schedule a cesarean delivery for nonmedical reasons, but this isn’t recommended. A cesarean delivery is major surgery and there’s a greater risk for complications, including:

blood clots
Pros of an elective C-section:
Lower risk of incontinence and sexual dysfunction after the birth of the baby.
Lower risk of the baby being deprived of oxygen during delivery.

A cesarean delivery might be scheduled by your doctor in advance of your due date. Or it may become necessary during labor because of an emergency.vishnu1$What are the medical reasons for a C-section?
A cesarean delivery might be scheduled by your doctor in advance of your due date. Or it may become necessary during labor because of an emergency.
Below are some of the most common medical reasons for a cesarean.
Prolonged labor
Prolonged labor — also called “failure to progress” or “stalled labor”— is the reason for nearly one-third of cesareans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTrusted Source. It happens when a new mom is in labor for 20 hours or more. Or 14 hours or more for moms who’ve given birth before.vishnu1$Babies that are too large for the birth canal, slow cervical thinning, and carrying multiples can all prolong labor. In these cases, doctors consider a cesarean to avoid complications.
Abnormal positioning
In order to have a successful vaginal birth, babies should be positioned headfirst near the birth canal.
But babies sometimes flip the script. They can position their feet or butt toward the canal, known as a breech birth, or position their shoulder or side first, known as a transverse birth.vishnu1$But babies sometimes flip the script. They can position their feet or butt toward the canal, known as a breech birth, or position their shoulder or side first, known as a transverse birth.
A cesarean may be the safest way to deliver in these cases, especially for women carrying multiple babies.
Fetal distress
Your doctor may choose to deliver via emergency cesarean if your baby is not getting enough oxygen.
Birth defectsvishnu1$Fetal distress
Your doctor may choose to deliver via emergency cesarean if your baby is not getting enough oxygen.
Birth defects
To reduce delivery complications,doctors will choose to deliver babies diagnosed with certain birth defects, like excess fluid in the brain or congenital heart diseases, through a cesarean to reduce delivery complications.
Repeat cesarean
About 90 percent of women who’ve had a cesarean can deliver vaginally for their next birth, according to the American Pregnancy Association. This is known as vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC).vishnu1$About 90 percent of women who’ve had a cesarean can deliver vaginally for their next birth, according to the American Pregnancy Association. This is known as vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC).
Moms-to-be should talk with their physician to decide whether a VBAC or repeat cesarean is the best and safest option.
Chronic health condition
Women may deliver via cesarean if they live with certain chronic health conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, or gestational diabetes. Vaginal delivery with one of these conditions may be dangerous for mom.vishnu1$Doctors will also suggest a cesarean if the mom-to-be has HIV, genital herpes, or any other infection that could be transferred to the baby through vaginal delivery.
Cord prolapse
When the umbilical cord slips through the cervix before the baby is born, it’s called a cord prolapse. This can lessen blood flow to the baby, putting the baby’s health at risk.
While rare, a cord prolapse is a serious condition that requires an emergency cesarean delivery.
Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD)vishnu1$While rare, a cord prolapse is a serious condition that requires an emergency cesarean delivery.
Cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD)
A CPD is when a mom-to-be’s pelvis is too small to deliver the baby vaginally, or if the baby’s head is too large for the birth canal. In either case, the baby can’t pass through the vagina safely.
Placenta issuesvishnu1$Placenta issues
Doctors will perform a cesarean when the low-lying placenta partially or completely covers the cervix (placenta previa). A cesarean is also necessary when the placenta separates from the uterine lining, causing the baby to lose oxygen (placenta abruption).
According to the American Pregnancy Association, placenta previa happens to 1 in every 200 pregnant women. About 1 percent of pregnant women experience placental abruption.
Carrying multiplesvishnu1$According to the American Pregnancy Association, placenta previa happens to 1 in every 200 pregnant women. About 1 percent of pregnant women experience placental abruption.
Carrying multiples
Carrying multiples can pose different risks during pregnancy. It can cause prolonged labor, which can put mom in distress. One or more babies may also be in an abnormal position. Either way, a cesarean is often the safest route for delivery.
Exercises to Help with Your C-Section Recovery:vishnu1$Cesarean deliveries are sometimes medically necessary, but the recovery time is slightly longer than a vaginal birth. For this reason, caution should be taken. Moms should get their doctor’s OK before returning to regular exercise. Some key muscles that require retraining after pregnancy include the transverse abdominis. These are the corset-like muscles that wrap around the midline to the spine, the pelvic floor muscles, and the abdominal and lower back muscles. After a cesarean delivery, it’s important to activate and strengthen these areas so that they can provide support, decrease your risk of injury, and help you make a full recovery postpartum. Try these gentle exercises after a cesarean delivery. They require no equipment and can be performed from anywhere.vishnu1$1. Belly breathing
This exercise is a great relaxation technique. It also helps retrain the core muscles to work together during daily activities. Muscles worked: transverse abdominis
Lie on your back on a comfortable bed or couch.
Place your hands on your belly and relax your body.
Take a deep breath in through your nose, feeling your abdomen expand into your hands.
Breathe out through your mouth. As you exhale, pull your bellybutton in toward your spine, contracting your abdominal muscles. Hold for 3 seconds.
Repeat 5 to 10 times, 3 times a day.
2. Seated kegelsvishnu1$Repeat 5 to 10 times, 3 times a day.
2. Seated kegels
A layer of connective tissue called the fascia connects the muscles of the abdominals to the pelvic floor and helps them work together for optimal performance. Kegels are an excellent exercise to strengthen and activate the pelvic floor. They have been shown to decrease stress incontinence following childbirth. After a C-section you may have a urinary catheter and these exercises will help after the catheter is removed. Muscles worked: pelvic floor

4. Cesarean delivery scar massage
As a cesarean delivery scar heals, the different layers of skin and fascia can become adhered to each other, limiting your range of motion. These adhesions may lead to future problems like urinary frequency, or hip or back pain. A scar tissue massage, also referred to as scar tissue release, helps break up the adhesions and assists with proper tissue healing. Only begin scar massage after your scar is healed and your doctor gives you the green light. Areas worked: fascia, connective tissuevishnu1$Lie on your back with your fingers positioned above your scar. Pull the skin with your fingertips around the scar and observe its movement. Try sliding it up and down and side to side. Notice if it moves more easily in 1 direction than another.
Working in 1 direction, slowly move the scar back and forth. You will want to start off gently and gradually move up to a more aggressive massage.

If you notice an increase in bleeding, fatigue, or inflammation of the scar area, stop and seek medical help.
5. Leg slidesvishnu1$Generally, exercise should not start until six to eight weeks after the surgery and you should always check with your doctor before beginning. Low impact exercise such as yoga, Pilates, or swimming is the best way to begin. This beginner core exercise helps engage the core muscles in a gentle but effective way.

Here are six suggestions to help speed up your recovery so you can spend less time sore and tired — and more time bonding with your new baby.
1. Get plenty of restvishnu1$A cesarean delivery (C-section) is major surgery. Just like with any surgery, your body needs time to heal afterward.Expect to stay in the hospital for 2 to 4 days after your delivery. If there are complications, your stay will be longer. Give your body 6 to 8 weeks to fully heal.That’s easier said than done. It’s hard to crawl into bed for hours on end when you have a baby who’s demanding lots of attention.You’ve probably heard this advice from well-meaning friends and relatives: “Sleep whenever your baby sleeps.” They’re right. Try to sleep whenever your baby naps.Ask for help from those friends and relatives with diaper changes and housework so you can lie down when possible. Even a few minutes of rest here and there throughout the day can help.vishnu1$2. Baby your body
Take extra care in getting around while you heal. Follow these tips:
Avoid going up and down stairs as much as you can. Keep everything you need, like food and supplies for changing diapers, close to you so that you do not have to get up too often.vishnu1$Do not lift anything heavier than your baby. Ask for help from your partner, friends, or family members.Whenever you have to sneeze or cough, hold your abdomen to protect the incision site.It could take up to 8 weeks for you to get back into your normal routine. Ask your doctor when it’s fine to exercise, go back to work, and drive. Also wait to have sex or use tampons until your doctor gives you the green light.Avoid strenuous exercise, but do take gentle walks as often as you can. The movement will help your body heal and prevent constipation and blood clots. Plus, walks are a great way to introduce your baby to the world.Abdomen and pelvic floor exercises are beneficial following a cesarean delivery. To increase strength and stability in the core muscles, try breathing exercises, isometric contractions, and exercises that target the transverse abdominis. Regaining strength gradually will help you return to doing the activities you love with ease.vishnu1$3. Relieve your pain
Ask your doctor what pain medications you can take, especially if you’re breastfeeding or chestfeeding.Depending on the level of your discomfort, your doctor might prescribe a pain reliever or advise you to take an over-the-counter (OTC) one, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol).In addition to pain medication, you can use a heating pad to relieve discomfort at the surgical site.
4.Focus on good nutritionvishnu1$Good nutrition is just as important in the months after you deliver as it was while you were pregnant.If you’re breastfeeding or chestfeeding, you’re still your baby’s primary source of nutrition. Eating a variety of foods will keep your baby healthy and help you get stronger.A 2017 study shows that eating fruits and vegetables while breastfeeding imparts flavors in breast milk that increase your child’s enjoyment and consumption of those foods as they grow.Also, drink plenty of fluids, especially water. You need extra fluids to boost your milk supply and to avoid constipation.vishnu1$5. Manage postpartum changes
Your body will continue to undergo physical changes even after your baby is born. Changes you might experience include:
afterpains, a type of cramping that occurs as your uterus returns to its prepregnancy size
breast engorgement, or swelling
lochia, a type of vaginal discharge mostly made of blood

Learning more about what’s involved during and after a tummy tuck (and keeping in mind that it will piggyback your cesarean delivery) is a good way to highlight why combining procedures can be problematic.
What to expect during a tummy tuck
Before a tummy tuck, you’re given intravenous sedation, or a general aesthetic. A horizontal incision is then made between your bellybutton and the pubic hairline. The precise shape and length of this incision will vary from patient to patient, and it’s related to the amount of excess skin.vishnu1$Once the incision has been made, the abdominal skin is lifted so that repairs can be made to the muscles below. If there is excess skin in the upper abdomen, a second incision may be necessary.
Next, the abdominal skin is pulled down, trimmed, and sutured together. Your surgeon will create a new opening for your bellybutton, push it through to the surface, and suture that into place. Incisions are closed, and bandages are applied.vishnu1$You may also have a compression or elastic wrap that’s designed to reduce swelling and provide support to your abdomen during the healing process. In some cases, drainage tubes are also placed beneath the skin to drain blood or fluid.
A full tummy tuck can take anywhere from one to two hours, or longer.
Recovering from a tummy tuck usually involves medications to facilitate healing and to reduce the possibility of infection. You’ll also be instructed in how to care for the surgical site and drains if you have them.vishnu1$There will be required follow-up appointments with your doctor. You’ll also be instructed to minimize any lifting and rest as much as possible.
Problems with combining a tummy tuck and cesarean delivery
1. Disappointing resultsvishnu1$Problems with combining a tummy tuck and cesarean delivery
1. Disappointing results
The goal of a tummy tuck is to help you look your best. To make that happen, you should be in good physical condition before surgery. After carrying a baby for nine months, both your abdominal skin and your uterus have been impressively stretched. That makes it difficult for a surgeon to accurately determine how much tightening needs to be done. This can lead to disappointing results after you’ve healed.
2. Difficult recoveryvishnu1$2. Difficult recovery
Recovering from a tummy tuck or a cesarean delivery is difficult. Recovering from both surgeries at the same time, on top of caring for a newborn baby, is complicated and exhausting. You’ll be very restricted physically, making things difficult.
3. Surgeon logistics
There’s also the matter of finding a plastic surgeon who will agree to perform your tummy tuck immediately after your cesarean delivery. Keep in mind that anything can happen during labor and delivery, and you may find that your carefully scheduled plans don’t work out.
4. Complicationsvishnu1$4. Complications
Both procedures have risks, and combining them can increase the potential for complications. A woman may be at an increased risk of blood clots and fluid retention. There’s also a greater chance of infection when the uterus is undergoing surgery, as well as the abdominal wall.
What’s the best time for a tummy tuck after a C-section?
If a tummy tuck is something you’re considering after a cesarean delivery, speak with a certified plastic surgeon. For the best results, you should be back to your original weight and be in good physical condition.vishnu1$Plan a tummy tuck only if you aren’t planning on becoming pregnant again. Otherwise, you may go through the cost and aggravation of the surgery and recovery only to find your abdomen stretched out again.

  Taking Care of a Baby at Home After Birth:  
What Families Need to Do  
 
Introduction  
 
This flipbook contains key messages that pregnant women and their families need in order to plan care of an infant at 
home right after birth. It focuses on essential actions families can take both to prevent newborn death and illness and to 
promote healthy newborn development.

health services. While efforts are made to reach this goal, nearly 60 million  births in developing countries still take place at 
home w ithout skilled care,1 contributing heavily to total maternal and infant deaths.

In response to this situation, WHO and UNICEF recommend a postnatal visit to a health facility as soon as possible after a 
home birth. Where this is not possible, they promote home visits to mother and infant within 24 hours, on the third day 
and, if possible, before the end of the first week (seven days) after the birth.2

It's important to observe your baby's reactions and interests to determine what they enjoy and what stimulates their development. Additionally, spending time talking, singing, and reading to your baby can also help encourage language development and bonding.$$$The first hour after birth when a mother has uninterrupted skin-to-skin contact with her newborn is referred to as the “golden hour.” Research has shown that what happens during the first 60 minutes of a baby's life, which is often referred to as the golden hour, can maximize the bonding between mother and child. “The golden hour is very beneficial and critical for even years down the road between both mom and baby.This period of time is critical for a newborn baby who spent the past nine months in a controlled environment.As long as mom and baby are well, immediate and continuous skin-to-skin contact is recommended.vishnu1$The Golden Minute refers to the first 60 s of a newborn's life,7 during which the complex but natural transition from intra- to extrauterine life occurs. Typically, midwives perform newborn assessment during the Golden Minute.vishnu1$**************************************** C-section ***************************************************************vishnu1$what is a c-section operation?vishnu1$Cesarean delivery (C-section) is used to deliver a baby through surgical incisions made in the abdomen and uterus.In C-section a 10 to 20cm cut is made in your tummy and womb.Planning for a C-section might be necessary if there are certain pregnancy complications. In C-section a 10 to 20cm cut is made in your tummy and womb – this will usually be a horizontal cut just below your bikini line, although sometimes a vertical cut below your bellybutton may be made. And your baby is delivered through the opening – this usually takes 5 to 10 minutes and you may feel some tugging at this point.A cesarean delivery is a surgery where an incision is made through the abdominal wall to deliver a baby quickly and safely. Cesarean deliveries are sometimes medically necessary, but the recovery time is slightly longer than a vaginal birth.You won't feel any pain during the C-section, although you may feel sensations like pulling and pressure. Most women are awake and simply numbed from the waist down using regional anesthesia (an epidural and/or a spinal block) during a C-section. That way, they are awake to see and hear their baby being born.Is C-section as painful as natural birth? Even though labor and vaginal birth can be hard work, they are generally easier on a woman's body than a cesarean. Recovery after vaginal birth is usually shorter and less painful than after a C-section, and allows the woman to spend more time with her baby.Often, however, the need for a first-time C-section isn' clear until after labor starts.Once the baby is delivered the uterus is closed with a double layer of stitching. Four of the five remaining layers are stitched with a single layer of stitching, but one layer is not restitched as it heals better – with no buckling and reduced chance of scar tissue developing, without restitiching.vishnu1$Health care providers might recommend a C-section if:vishnu1$Labor isn't progressing normally. Labor that isn't progressing (labor dystocia) is one of the most common reasons for a C-section. Issues with labor progression include prolonged first stage (prolonged dilation or opening of the cervix) or prolonged second stage (prolonged time of pushing after complete cervical dilation).vishnu1$The baby is in distress. Concern about changes in a baby's heartbeat might make a C-section the safest option.vishnu1$The baby or babies are in an unusual position. A C-section is the safest way to deliver babies whose feet or buttocks enter the birth canal first (breech) or babies whose sides or shoulders come first (transverse).vishnu1$You're carrying more than one baby. A C-section might be needed for women carrying twins, triplets or more. This is especially true if labor starts too early or the babies are not in a head-down position.vishnu1$There's a problem with the placenta. If the placenta covers the opening of the cervix (placenta previa), a C-section is recommended for delivery.
Prolapsed umbilical cord. A C-section might be recommended if a loop of umbilical cord slips through the cervix in front of the baby.vishnu1$Prolapsed umbilical cord. A C-section might be recommended if a loop of umbilical cord slips through the cervix in front of the baby.
There's a health concern. A C-section might be recommended for women with certain health issues, such as a heart or brain condition.vishnu1$There's a blockage. A large fibroid blocking the birth canal, a pelvic fracture or a baby who has a condition that can cause the head to be unusually large (severe hydrocephalus) might be reasons for a C-section.vishnu1$You've had a previous C-section or other surgery on the uterus. Although it's often possible to have a vaginal birth after a C-section, a health care provider might recommend a repeat C-section.vishnu1$Some women request C-sections with their first babies. They might want to avoid labor or the possible complications of vaginal birth. Or they might want to plan the time of delivery. However, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, this might not be a good option for women who plan to have several children. The more C-sections a woman has, the greater the risk of problems with future pregnancies.vishnu1$Like other types of major surgery, C-sections carry risks.vishnu1$Risks to babies include:
Breathing problems. Babies born by scheduled C-section are more likely to develop a breathing issue that causes them to breathe too fast for a few days after birth (transient tachypnea).
Surgical injury. Although rare, accidental nicks to the baby's skin can occur during surgery.

Reactions to anesthesia. Reactions to any type of anesthesia are possible.vishnu1$Blood clots. A C-section might increase the risk of developing a blood clot inside a deep vein, especially in the legs or pelvis (deep vein thrombosis). If a blood clot travels to the lungs and blocks blood flow (pulmonary embolism), the damage can be life-threatening.vishnu1$Surgical injury. Although rare, surgical injuries to the bladder or bowel can occur during a C-section.vishnu1$Increased risks during future pregnancies. Having a C-section increases the risk of complications in a later pregnancy and in other surgeries. The more C-sections, the higher the risks of placenta previa and a condition in which the placenta becomes attached to the wall of the uterus (placenta accreta).vishnu1$A C-section also increases the risk of the uterus tearing along the scar line (uterine rupture) for women who attempt a vaginal delivery in a later pregnancy.vishnu1$For a planned C-section, a health care provider might suggest talking with an anesthesiologist if there are medical conditions that might increase the risk of anesthesia complications.vishnu1$A health care provider might also recommend certain blood tests before a C-section. These tests provide information about blood type and the level of the main component of red blood cells (hemoglobin). The test results can be helpful in case you need a blood transfusion during the C-section.vishnu1$Even for a planned vaginal birth, it's important to prepare for the unexpected. Discuss the possibility of a C-section with your health care provider well before your due date.vishnu1$If you don't plan to have more children, you might talk to your health care provider about long-acting reversible birth control or permanent birth control. A permanent birth control procedure might be performed at the time of the C-section.vishnu1$A C-section can be done in various ways. But most C-sections involve these steps:vishnu1$At home. Your health care provider might ask you to shower at home with an antiseptic soap the night before and the morning of your C-section. Don't shave your pubic hair within 24 hours of your C-section. This can increase the risk of a surgical site infection. If your pubic hair needs to be removed, it will be trimmed by the surgical staff just before surgery.vishnu1$At the hospital. Your abdomen will be cleansed. A thin tube (catheter) will likely be placed into your bladder to collect urine. An intravenous line will be placed in a vein in your hand or arm to provide fluid and drugs, including antibiotics to prevent infection.vishnu1$Anesthesia. Most C-sections are done under regional anesthesia, which numbs only the lower part of your body. This allows you to be awake during the procedure. Common choices include a spinal block and an epidural block.vishnu1$Some C-sections might require general anesthesia. With general anesthesia, you won't be awake during the birth.
During the c-section procedure:vishnu1$A doctor makes surgical incisions in the abdomen and the uterus to deliver the baby.A 10 to 20cm cut is made in your tummy and womb.vishnu1$Abdominal incision: A 10 to 20cm cut is made in your tummy and womb. The doctor makes an incision in the abdominal wall. It's usually done horizontally near the pubic hairline. Or the doctor might make a vertical incision from just below the navel to just above the pubic bone.vishnu1$Uterine incision. The uterine incision is then made — usually horizontally across the lower part of the uterus (low transverse incision). Other types of uterine incisions might be used depending on the baby's position within the uterus and whether there are complications, such as placenta previa or preterm delivery.vishnu1$Delivery. The baby will be delivered through the incisions. The doctor clears the baby's mouth and nose of fluids, then clamps and cuts the umbilical cord. The placenta is then removed from the uterus, and the incisions are closed with sutures.vishnu1$If you have regional anesthesia, you're likely to be able to hold the baby shortly after delivery.
After the c-section procedure:vishnu1$After the c-section procedure:
A C-section usually requires a hospital stay for 2 to 3 days. Your health care provider will discuss pain relief options with you.vishnu1$Once the anesthesia begins to wear off, you'll be encouraged to drink fluids and walk. This helps prevent constipation and deep vein thrombosis. Your health care team will monitor your incision for signs of infection. The bladder catheter will likely be removed as soon as possible.vishnu1$You can start breastfeeding as soon as you're ready, even in the delivery room. Ask your nurse or a lactation consultant to teach you how to position yourself and support your baby so that you're comfortable. Your health care team will select medications for your post-surgical pain with breastfeeding in mind.vishnu1$When you go home after c-section operation:
During the C-section recovery process, discomfort and fatigue are common. To promote healing:vishnu1$Take it easy. Rest when possible. Try to keep everything that you and your baby need within reach. For the first few weeks, don't lift more than 25 pounds.vishnu1$Use recommended pain relief. To soothe incision soreness, your health care provider might recommend a heating pad and pain medications that are safe for breastfeeding women and their babies. These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and acetaminophen (Tylenol, others).vishnu1$Wait to have sex. To prevent infection, wait at least six weeks to have sex and don't put anything in your vagina after your C-section.
Wait to drive. If you're taking narcotics for pain relief, it might take 1 to 2 weeks before you can comfortably apply brakes and twist to check blind spots.vishnu1$Wait to drive.

What are the medical reasons for a C-section?
A cesarean delivery might be scheduled by your doctor in advance of your due date. Or it may become necessary during labor because of an emergency.
Below are some of the most common medical reasons for a cesarean.
Prolonged laborvishnu1$Prolonged laborvishnu1$Prolonged laborvishnu1$Prolonged labor
Prolonged labor — also called “failure to progress” or “stalled labor”— is the reason for nearly one-third of cesareans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTrusted Source. It happens when a new mom is in labor for 20 hours or more. Or 14 hours or more for moms who’ve given birth before.vishnu1$Babies that are too large for the birth canal, slow cervical thinning, and carrying multiples can all prolong labor. In these cases, doctors consider a cesarean to avoid complications.
Abnormal positioningvishnu1$Abnormal positioning
In order to have a successful vaginal birth, babies should be positioned headfirst near the birth canal.
But babies sometimes flip the script. They can position their feet or butt toward the canal, known as a breech birth, or position their shoulder or side first, known as a transverse birth.vishnu1$A cesarean may be the safest way to deliver in these cases, especially for women carrying multiple babies.
Fetal distress
Your doctor may choose to deliver via emergency cesarean if your baby is not getting enough oxygen.
Birth defectsvishnu1$Fetal distress
Your doctor may choose to deliver via emergency cesarean if your baby is not getting enough oxygen.
Birth defects
To reduce delivery complications,doctors will choose to deliver babies diagnosed with certain birth defects, like excess fluid in the brain or congenital heart diseases, through a cesarean to reduce delivery complications.
Repeat cesareanvishnu1$Repeat cesarean
About 90 percent of women who’ve had a cesarean can deliver vaginally for their next birth, according to the American Pregnancy Association. This is known as vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC).vishnu1$About 90 percent of women who’ve had a cesarean can deliver vaginally for their next birth, according to the American Pregnancy Association.

Moms-to-be should talk with their physician to decide whether a VBAC or repeat cesarean is the best and safest option.
Chronic health conditionvishnu1$Chronic health condition
Women may deliver via cesarean if they live with certain chronic health conditions like heart disease, high blood pressure, or gestational diabetes. Vaginal delivery with one of these conditions may be dangerous for mom.vishnu1$Doctors will also suggest a cesarean if the mom-to-be has HIV, genital herpes, or any other infection that could be transferred to the baby through vaginal delivery.
Cord prolapsevishnu1$Cord prolapse
When the umbilical cord slips through the cervix before the baby is born, it’s called a cord prolapse. This can lessen blood flow to the baby, putting the baby’s health at risk.
While rare, a cord prolapse is a serious condition that requires an emergency cesarean delivery.

A CPD is when a mom-to-be’s pelvis is too small to deliver the baby vaginally, or if the baby’s head is too large for the birth canal. In either case, the baby can’t pass through the vagina safely.
Placenta issuesvishnu1$Placenta issuesvishnu1$Placenta issuesvishnu1$Placenta issues
Doctors will perform a cesarean when the low-lying placenta partially or completely covers the cervix (placenta previa). A cesarean is also necessary when the placenta separates from the uterine lining, causing the baby to lose oxygen (placenta abruption).
According to the American Pregnancy Association, placenta previa happens to 1 in every 200 pregnant women. About 1 percent of pregnant women experience placental abruption.

Carrying multiples can pose different risks during pregnancy. It can cause prolonged labor, which can put mom in distress. One or more babies may also be in an abnormal position. Either way, a cesarean is often the safest route for delivery.vishnu1$Exercises to Help with Your C-Section Recovery:vishnu1$Cesarean deliveries are sometimes medically necessary, but the recovery time is slightly longer than a vaginal birth. For this reason, caution should be taken. Moms should get their doctor’s OK before returning to regular exercise. Some key muscles that require retraining after pregnancy include the transverse abdominis. These are the corset-like muscles that wrap around the midline to the spine, the pelvic floor muscles, and the abdominal and lower back muscles. After a cesarean delivery, it’s important to activate and strengthen these areas so that they can provide support, decrease your risk of injury, and help you make a full recovery postpartum. Try these gentle exercises after a cesarean delivery. They require no equipment and can be performed from anywhere.vishnu1$1. Belly breathingvishnu1$This exercise is a great relaxation technique. It also helps retrain the core muscles to work together during daily activities. Muscles worked: transverse abdominis
Lie on your back on a comfortable bed or couch.
Place your hands on your belly and relax your body.
Take a deep breath in through your nose, feeling your abdomen expand into your hands.vishnu1$Breathe out through your mouth. As you exhale, pull your bellybutton in toward your spine, contracting your abdominal muscles. Hold for 3 seconds.
Repeat 5 to 10 times, 3 times a day.
2. Seated kegelsvishnu1$2. Seated kegelsvishnu1$Repeat 5 to 10 times, 3 times a day.
2. Seated kegelsvishnu1$2. Seated kegels
A layer of connective tissue called the fascia connects the muscles of the abdominals to the pelvic floor and helps them work together for optimal performance. Kegels are an excellent exercise to strengthen and activate the pelvic floor. They have been shown to decrease stress incontinence following childbirth. After a C-section you may have a urinary catheter and these exercises will help after the catheter is removed. Muscles worked: pelvic floorvishnu1$Sit on the edge of a chair with your feet on the floor.vishnu1$Contract the muscles of the pelvic floor. It should feel like you’re trying to hold back the flow of urine.
Imagine you’re closing all the openings of the vagina, anus, and urethra. Imagine lifting them up away from the chair.
Hold this contraction as long as possible. Start with 5 seconds and work up to a longer duration.
Take a deep breath in and then breathe out fully, relaxing the contraction.vishnu1$Try Kegels in different positions like standing or lying on your side.
Perform 8 to 12 times with a 2-minute rest between contractions. Repeat 2 times per day.
3. Wall sitvishnu1$Perform 8 to 12 times with a 2-minute rest between contractions. Repeat 2 times per day.
3. Wall sit
This full-body isometric exercise is an excellent way to get all the muscle groups to work together in unison. Muscles worked: quadriceps, hamstrings, pelvic floor muscles, core, and lower back
Stand with your feet 1 to 2 feet away from the wall.vishnu1$Slowly lean back toward the wall, lowering yourself into a sitting position. Your hips and knees should be at 90-degrees to one another.vishnu1$Stand with your feet 1 to 2 feet away from the wall.vishnu1$Slowly lean back toward the wall, lowering yourself into a sitting position.

For an added bonus, contract your pelvic floor by doing a Kegel while holding this position.
Hold for as long as possible. Rest 1 minute, then repeat 5 times.vishnu1$4. Cesarean delivery scar massagevishnu1$As a cesarean delivery scar heals, the different layers of skin and fascia can become adhered to each other, limiting your range of motion. These adhesions may lead to future problems like urinary frequency, or hip or back pain. A scar tissue massage, also referred to as scar tissue release, helps break up the adhesions and assists with proper tissue healing. Only begin scar massage after your scar is healed and your doctor gives you the green light. Areas worked: fascia, connective tissuevishnu1$Lie on your back with your fingers positioned above your scar. Pull the skin with your fingertips around the scar and observe its movement. Try sliding it up and down and side to side. Notice if it moves more easily in 1 direction than another.vishnu1$Working in 1 direction, slowly move the scar back and forth. You will want to start off gently and gradually move up to a more aggressive massage.vishnu1$Move the scar up and down, side to side, and even around in circles. Small movements are better, but tissue mobilization can be done in all areas of the abdomen.vishnu1$If the scar is painful, stop and try again at a later date. Once you feel comfortable, you can perform this massage once a day.vishnu1$Note: Be sure to consult your doctor before engaging in exercise postpartum. Always start small, working up to more challenging movements. Avoid activities that place a lot of stress on the abdominal muscles and hip joints. If possible, consult a physical therapist or postpartum exercise specialist. If you notice an increase in bleeding, fatigue, or inflammation of the scar area, stop and seek medical help.vishnu1$5. Leg slidesvishnu1$Generally, exercise should not start until six to eight weeks after the surgery and you should always check with your doctor before beginning. Low impact exercise such as yoga, Pilates, or swimming is the best way to begin. This beginner core exercise helps engage the core muscles in a gentle but effective way. The transverse abdominis muscle is an important area to strengthen as it supports the body core. Also, it supports the linea alba, a fibrous structure that extends from the xiphoid process down to the pubic bone and also supports core stability. Muscles worked: transverse abdominisvishnu1$Lie on your back on the floor with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Wear socks or put a towel under your feet to allow your feet to slide easily on the floor.vishnu1$Take a deep breath.

Repeat 10 times on each side. Perform once per day.
Here are six suggestions to help speed up your recovery so you can spend less time sore and tired — and more time bonding with your new baby.vishnu1$1. Get plenty of restvishnu1$A cesarean delivery (C-section) is major surgery. Just like with any surgery, your body needs time to heal afterward.Expect to stay in the hospital for 2 to 4 days after your delivery. If there are complications, your stay will be longer. Give your body 6 to 8 weeks to fully heal.That’s easier said than done. It’s hard to crawl into bed for hours on end when you have a baby who’s demanding lots of attention.You’ve probably heard this advice from well-meaning friends and relatives: “Sleep whenever your baby sleeps.” They’re right. Try to sleep whenever your baby naps.Ask for help from those friends and relatives with diaper changes and housework so you can lie down when possible. Even a few minutes of rest here and there throughout the day can help.vishnu1$2. Baby your bodyvishnu1$Take extra care in getting around while you heal. Follow these tips:vishnu1$Avoid going up and down stairs as much as you can. Keep everything you need, like food and supplies for changing diapers, close to you so that you do not have to get up too often.vishnu1$Do not lift anything heavier than your baby. Ask for help from your partner, friends, or family members.Whenever you have to sneeze or cough, hold your abdomen to protect the incision site.It could take up to 8 weeks for you to get back into your normal routine. Ask your doctor when it’s fine to exercise, go back to work, and drive. Also wait to have sex or use tampons until your doctor gives you the green light.Avoid strenuous exercise, but do take gentle walks as often as you can. The movement will help your body heal and prevent constipation and blood clots. Plus, walks are a great way to introduce your baby to the world.Abdomen and pelvic floor exercises are beneficial following a cesarean delivery. To increase strength and stability in the core muscles, try breathing exercises, isometric contractions, and exercises that target the transverse abdominis. Regaining strength gradually will help you return to doing the activities you love with ease.vishnu1$3. Relieve your painvishnu1$Ask your doctor what pain medications you can take, especially if you’re breastfeeding or chestfeeding.Depending on the level of your discomfort, your doctor might prescribe a pain reliever or advise you to take an over-the-counter (OTC) one, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol).In addition to pain medication, you can use a heating pad to relieve discomfort at the surgical site.vishnu1$4.Focus on good nutritionvishnu1$Good nutrition is just as important in the months after you deliver as it was while you were pregnant.If you’re breastfeeding or chestfeeding, you’re still your baby’s primary source of nutrition. Eating a variety of foods will keep your baby healthy and help you get stronger.A 2017 study shows that eating fruits and vegetables while breastfeeding imparts flavors in breast milk that increase your child’s enjoyment and consumption of those foods as they grow.Also, drink plenty of fluids, especially water. You need extra fluids to boost your milk supply and to avoid constipation.vishnu1$5. Manage postpartum changesvishnu1$Your body will continue to undergo physical changes even after your baby is born. Changes you might experience include:
afterpains, a type of cramping that occurs as your uterus returns to its prepregnancy size
breast engorgement, or swelling
lochia, a type of vaginal discharge mostly made of blood
vaginal dryness

6. Go to postpartum checkups
The 12 weeks after your baby is born are sometimes known as the 4th trimester.vishnu1$The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that people see their OB-GYN or another doctor multiple times during this period.vishnu1$The first assessment should take place no later than 3 weeks postpartum. A comprehensive final visit should occur no later than 12 weeks postpartum.
During these checkups, you and your doctor will discuss topics like:
your physical recovery
your mental health
your energy levels and how you’re sleepingvishnu1$your energy levels and how you’re sleeping
how your baby is doing and their feeding schedule

What’s a tummy tuck?vishnu1$What’s a tummy tuck?
It sounds deceptively minimal, but a tummy tuck is actually major surgery. The cosmetic procedure involves cutting and sculpting of muscle, tissue, and skin.vishnu1$Excess fat and skin is removed. The goal is to restore weakened or separated abdominal muscles. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, a protruding abdomen, or one that is loose or saggy, can be a result of:
heredity
a previous surgery
aging
pregnancy
major changes in weightvishnu1$heredity

Learning more about what’s involved during and after a tummy tuck (and keeping in mind that it will piggyback your cesarean delivery) is a good way to highlight why combining procedures can be problematic.vishnu1$What to expect during a tummy tuckvishnu1$Before a tummy tuck, you’re given intravenous sedation, or a general aesthetic. A horizontal incision is then made between your bellybutton and the pubic hairline. The precise shape and length of this incision will vary from patient to patient, and it’s related to the amount of excess skin.vishnu1$Once the incision has been made, the abdominal skin is lifted so that repairs can be made to the muscles below. If there is excess skin in the upper abdomen, a second incision may be necessary.vishnu1$Next, the abdominal skin is pulled down, trimmed, and sutured together. Your surgeon will create a new opening for your bellybutton, push it through to the surface, and suture that into place. Incisions are closed, and bandages are applied.vishnu1$You may also have a compression or elastic wrap that’s designed to reduce swelling and provide support to your abdomen during the healing process. In some cases, drainage tubes are also placed beneath the skin to drain blood or fluid.vishnu1$A full tummy tuck can take anywhere from one to two hours, or longer.vishnu1$Recovering from a tummy tuck usually involves medications to facilitate healing and to reduce the possibility of infection. You’ll also be instructed in how to care for the surgical site and drains if you have them.
There will be required follow-up appointments with your doctor. You’ll also be instructed to minimize any lifting and rest as much as possible.
Problems with combining a tummy tuck and cesarean delivery
1. Disappointing resultsvishnu1$1. Disappointing resultsvishnu1$Problems with combining a tummy tuck and cesarean delivery
1. Disappointing resultsvishnu1$1. Disappointing results
The goal of a tummy tuck is to help you look your best. To make that happen, you should be in good physical condition before surgery. After carrying a baby for nine months, both your abdominal skin and your uterus have been impressively stretched. That makes it difficult for a surgeon to accurately determine how much tightening needs to be done. This can lead to disappointing results after you’ve healed.
2. Difficult recoveryvishnu1$2. Difficult recoveryvishnu1$2. Difficult recoveryvishnu1$2. Difficult recovery
Recovering from a tummy tuck or a cesarean delivery is difficult. Recovering from both surgeries at the same time, on top of caring for a newborn baby, is complicated and exhausting. You’ll be very restricted physically, making things difficult.

4. Complicationsvishnu1$4. Complicationsvishnu1$4. Complicationsvishnu1$4. Complications
Both procedures have risks, and combining them can increase the potential for complications. A woman may be at an increased risk of blood clots and fluid retention. There’s also a greater chance of infection when the uterus is undergoing surgery, as well as the abdominal wall.
What’s the best time for a tummy tuck after a C-section?vishnu1$If a tummy tuck is something you’re considering after a cesarean delivery, speak with a certified plastic surgeon. For the best results, you should be back to your original weight and be in good physical condition.vishnu1$Plan a tummy tuck only if you aren’t planning on becoming pregnant again. Otherwise, you may go through the cost and aggravation of the surgery and recovery only to find your abdomen stretched out again.vishnu1$Keep in mind that the procedure involves anesthetic and medications. These can be a problem if you’re breast-feeding. Talk to your doctor about what you should and shouldn’t be taking.vishnu1$There may be benefits to getting a tummy tuck after having a baby. You may be a candidate if you’re physically healthy and your weight has stabilized. But it’s important to allow your body time to heal from both your pregnancy and your cesarean delivery.vishnu1$You won’t want to miss out on enjoying that early bonding time with your new baby with the added stress of recovery from a tummy tuck.vishnu1$********************************************** FAQ's *************************************************************vishnu1$The trend in elective cesarean deliveries is growing. One study showed that 8 percentTrusted Source of mothers requested an elective cesarean delivery. While popular, this trend can have serious complications, including the risk of blood loss, infection, blood clots, and adverse reactions to anesthesia. It’s important to remember that a cesarean delivery is a major abdominal surgery, and typically has a longer recovery than a vaginal delivery. If you’re thinking about scheduling an elective cesarean delivery, you should talk to your doctor more about the risks and benefits.vishnu1$*********************************** BURPING *******************************************vishnu1$Burping your baby:

During their first three months, about half of all babies experience their stomach contents coming back up into the esophagus, a condition known as gastroesophageal reflux, infant reflux or infant acid reflux. Normally, a muscle between the esophagus and the stomach (lower esophageal sphincter) keeps stomach contents where they belong. Until this muscle has time to mature, spitting up might be an issue — especially if your baby is relatively full.vishnu1$What is the difference between spitting up and vomiting?vishnu1$Spitting up is the easy flow of a baby's stomach contents through his or her mouth, possibly with a burp. Vomiting occurs when the flow is forceful — shooting out inches rather than dribbling from the mouth.vishnu1$It seems like my baby is spitting up a lot. Can spitting up affect my baby's growth?vishnu1$Normal spitting up doesn't interfere with a baby's well-being. As long as your baby seems comfortable and is eating well and gaining weight, there's little cause for concern. If your baby is gaining weight, then he or she isn't being harmed by the calories lost through spitting up.Keep in mind that it's easy to overestimate the amount your baby has spit up based on the size of a spit-up stain.

A bloated baby belly due to gas is therefore quite common and usually doesn’t require any special treatments. Gas is particularly common in infants between one and four months, as their digestive systems are still developing. Read on to learn more about infant gas relief and effective ways to relieve gas.vishnu1$Why do babies get bloated bellies?vishnu1$Many things can result in a gassy baby. Infants often swallow air when they’re crying, sucking a pacifier, and eating (whether milk comes from a bottle or a breast).Babies can become gassy if they swallow excessive air in the wrong feeding position, if they eat too much, or if they’re constipated. Newborn babies may also have allergies or intolerances to ingredients in formula or breast milk, leading to gas. Furthermore, infants’ digestive systems are still developing and learning to effectively process food, stool, and gas.vishnu1$Follow my baby's growthvishnu1$Quiz Image

Effective positions to relieve gas:vishnu1$One of the ways to relieve infant gas is to try holding your baby in different positions. Burping babies helps remove some of the air that babies swallow when eating. Try to use different positions while burping that feel comfortable for both of you. Try one of these three positions to relieve gas:vishnu1$Sit upright and hold your infant against your chest. In this position, your baby’s chin will be on your shoulder while you support them with your hand. Gently pat your baby on the back.vishnu1$Hold your infant sitting up across your knee or in your lap. In this position, you will be gently supporting your baby’s head and chest by holding their chin. With the heel of your hand on your baby’s chest, be careful to hold your baby’s chin and not their throat. With your other hand, pat your baby’s back gently.vishnu1$Lay your baby face down on your lap. In this position, support your baby’s head and ensure that it’s higher than their chest. Pat their back gently.vishnu1$Gas can affect both bottle-fed and breastfed babies equally. A frequently gassy baby is usually no cause for concern and quite normal. You can follow certain tips to help relieve your infant’s gas and make them feel better.

If your baby is gassy from bottle-feeding, it might help to try a different kind of nipple and bottle combination. Soft nipples, which contour along your baby’s lips and mouth, can help prevent the accident flow of excess air when your baby is drinking.vishnu1$Furthermore, the milk should be able to flow slowly and gradually so the baby has enough time to drink without gulping it excessively. While bottle-feeding, it’s best for babies to take between 20 minutes and one hour to finish eating.vishnu1$If they finish in five minutes, they are gulping too quickly and swallowing excess air. In cases like these, the nipple flow is probably too large for their age. Try switching to a nipple with a slower flow. 
2. Adjust the feeding positionvishnu1$2. Adjust the feeding position

To provide your infant with gas relief, talk to their doctor about foods that may cause extra gas. Some fruit juices contain sorbitols or sugar alcohols that babies can’t absorb, causing gas. The doctor will also make sure your baby is getting all the essential nutrients they need.vishnu1$If you are breastfeeding, foods you’ve eaten can also cause your baby to be gassy. If you give your baby formula, you can try switching brands. Some brands claim to prevent gas.vishnu1$Reasons to call a doctor
Most of the time, it’s normal for an infant to have gas and it’s treatable. In rare instances, more serious problems of the digestive tract can also cause gas. You should contact the doctor immediately if your infant exhibits any of the following:
They are vomiting, aren’t passing stools, or have blood in their stools.vishnu1$They are extremely fussy. If you aren’t able to calm your baby, a doctor can check to rule out any problems.vishnu1$They have a high temperature. If the rectal temperature of your baby is 100.4 F ( 38 °C) or more, make sure a doctor rules out an infection. If your baby is younger than three months and has a fever, take them to a doctor immediately.vishnu1$It is very common for babies to become gassy, and there are a number of reasons for that. Babies swallow air while crying, sucking a pacifier, and eating. Furthermore, babies’ digestive systems are still developing, which can sometimes lead to gas and a bloated belly. A gassy baby may belch, burp, pass gas, and have a hard distended tummy. You can follow certain tips to help relieve gas and make your baby feel better. In rare instances, certain symptoms may indicate a more serious problem. If your baby is experiencing gas along with other, more serious symptoms, get them checked by a doctor.vishnu1$There are numerous causes of gas in babies, including swallowing air, excessive crying, and more. Various methods can help to relieve gas in newborn and young babies. Examples include swaddling, burping, and tummy time.vishnu1$Gas is normal for babies and usually goes away on its own.
Babies may become gassy after they swallow air while crying or during feedings.
Home remedies such as moving their legs and raising their head may help soothe a gassy baby.vishnu1$When a baby has gas, tiny bubbles develop in their stomach or intestines, sometimes causing pressure and stomach pain.
Many gassy babies are not bothered by gas, but some become restless and cannot sleep until they have passed their gas. Others cry for hours.vishnu1$Many gassy babies are not bothered by gas, but some become restless and cannot sleep until they have passed their gas. Others cry for hours.
A handful of simple home remedies can usually soothe a baby and relieve their gas pains. In most cases, infant gas is nothing to worry about.vishnu1$However, discussing gas with a pediatrician can offer reassurance and help a parent or caregiver determine why the baby has gas.

Almost all babies get gas. Gas happens when air gets into the digestive tract, such as when a baby sucks on a bottle and swallows air. Gas does not usually mean anything is wrong.
Reasons a baby may become gassy include:
Swallowing airvishnu1$Swallowing air
Babies can swallow air if they latch onto the breast incorrectly, or if they nurse or drink from a bottle in certain positions. They can even swallow air just from babbling a lot.
Excessive cryingvishnu1$Babies can swallow air if they latch onto the breast incorrectly, or if they nurse or drink from a bottle in certain positions. They can even swallow air just from babbling a lot.
Excessive crying
Babies tend to swallow air when they cry. If this causes them to have gas, they may pass it after crying.vishnu1$It can be hard for someone to tell if gas is causing the baby to cry or if crying is causing their gas. Either way, it is important for a caregiver to try to promptly tend to a crying baby’s needs and soothe them in the best way possible.
Minor digestive problemsvishnu1$Minor digestive problems

Less commonly, gas may signal a gastrointestinal condition, such as acid reflux. A person can talk with a pediatrician about their baby’s gas, especially if the gas happens a lot or is severe.
An immature digestive tract
Babies’ bodies are learning how to digest food, so they tend to get more gas than adults.

Cradling them facedown
A person can try cradling the baby in their arms, but facedown instead of faceup. It is important to support the baby’s head and elevate it slightly, making sure nothing covers the baby’s face or nose.
Massaging their bellyvishnu1$Massaging their belly
Gently rubbing the baby’s stomach may relieve gas. A person can try pressing down in gentle clockwise or counterclockwise motions, letting the baby’s reactions guide the pressure.

Tummy time
Babies can benefit from tummy time while they are awake and supervised. Tummy time involves placing them on their tummy and letting them move around.
This can free trapped gas. It also strengthens their upper body muscles and encourages them to elevate their head.
Giving gas dropsvishnu1$This can free trapped gas. It also strengthens their upper body muscles and encourages them to elevate their head.
Giving gas drops
Simethicone gas drops help some babies and may be safe to give up to 12 times a day, as long as parents or caregivers follow the dosage on the bottle.vishnu1$However, a 2015 review of studies suggests these drops might be no better than a placebo at reducing crying or gas.
Probiotic supplementsvishnu1$Probiotic supplements
Research suggests that a probiotic supplement may help babies with colic by balancing their intestinal microorganisms. A 2019 review found that daily crying time was reduced in babies who were given a probiotic.vishnu1$However, researchers have not established the safety of probiotic supplements for infants, and there is no evidence to suggest appropriate infant dosing or which probiotic may work best.
If home remedies do not work and a baby’s gas is very bad, a person should talk with a pediatrician before giving a baby a probiotic.

How does a baby’s diet affect gas?vishnu1$How does a baby’s diet affect gas?
Breast milk is the biological standard of food for babies, and it is usually the healthiest choice when possible. There is no need to stop breastfeeding because a baby has gas.vishnu1$Infant formula may also cause gas. Mixing up infant formula can cause air bubbles to appear in a baby’s food, increasing the risk of gas. Try a premixed liquid formula instead, or give the formula a few minutes to settle before feeding the baby.vishnu1$Some babies may be sensitive to formula ingredients, such as soy or lactose. However, lactose intolerance is very rare in infants and is often temporary. Babies born prematurely may have developmental lactase deficiency, a condition that lasts for only a short time.vishnu1$A 2015 study of almost 300 infants found that lactose-free milk-based or soy-based formulas did not alleviate infants’ fussiness or crying.
A person should talk with a pediatrician before changing their baby’s formula.vishnu1$When a baby starts eating solids, keeping a food log can help with identifying food sensitivities that trigger gas.

Prevention
Some strategies that may help prevent gas include:vishnu1$Changing the feeding position: Try changing the baby’s position while they eat to ensure their head is slightly above their belly.vishnu1$Improving latch: Sometimes a weak latch causes a baby to swallow too much air. A person can talk with a lactation consultant if breastfeeding is painful, the baby seems frustrated, or the baby frequently unlatches from the breast. Going to a La Leche League meeting can also help.vishnu1$Slowing down feeding: Slowing down the rate at which formula-fed babies eat may help. Some babies drink bottles very quickly, causing them to swallow air. Try using a slow-flow nipple. People can find various brands online.vishnu1$Trying different bottles: Some babies get less gas when using different-shaped bottles, such as curved bottles. Regardless of the type of bottle, it is important to hold it up enough so that the base of the bottle is full of milk rather than air.vishnu1$Burping the baby more often: A person can try taking a break in the middle of each feed to burp the baby. Burp the baby after each meal, too.
Breastfeeding and gassy babyvishnu1$Breastfeeding and gassy baby
Many people who breastfeed may worry that their diet is the culprit. However, there is no evidenceTrusted Source that a breastfeeding parent should avoid certain gas-causing foods, such as beans, broccoli, and cabbage, to prevent a gassy baby. The gas and fiber from foods the parent eats are not passed into their breast milk.vishnu1$Breastfeeding can cause gas in a baby if air enters the baby’s mouth due to the following:
a loose latch on the nipple
gulping
crying

Occasionally, recurrent gas can lead to colic, which is intense crying that lasts longer than 3 hours a day for over 3 days a week.
However, although a colicky baby may be gassy, it is not the only cause.

Summary
Though many babies do not seem bothered by their gas, for others, gas can be frustrating and upsetting to both the baby and their caregivers.vishnu1$When a baby does not sleep well, the frequent crying can be especially exhausting and overwhelming. However, gas is a normal part of babyhood that usually goes away on its own.vishnu1$The days of problematic gas will likely soon be history as the baby grows, develops, and turns into a toddler. In the meantime, gentle management and a few home remedies can make stomach pain more manageable for babies and caregivers.vishnu1$************************************* Colic ******************************************vishnu1$Colic is when a healthy baby cries for a very long time, for no obvious reason. It affects some babies during the first 3 to 4 months of life. Colic usually begins suddenly, with loud and mostly nonstop crying. Colicky babies can be very difficult to calm down.Colic is frequent, prolonged and intense crying or fussiness in a healthy infant. Colic can be particularly frustrating for parents because the baby's distress occurs for no apparent reason and no amount of consoling seems to bring any relief. These episodes often occur in the evening, when parents themselves are often tired.vishnu1$Episodes of colic usually peak when an infant is about 6 weeks old and decline significantly after 3 to 4 months of age. While the excessive crying will resolve with time, managing colic adds significant stress to caring for your newborn child.vishnu1$You can take steps that may lessen the severity and duration of colic episodes, alleviate your own stress, and bolster confidence in your parent-child connection.
Symptomsvishnu1$Symptoms
Babies have been known to fuss and cry, especially during the first three months of life. The range for what's considered typical crying is difficult to pin down. In general, colic is defined as crying for three or more hours a day, three or more days a week, for three or more weeks.
Features of colic may include the following:vishnu1$Features of colic may include the following:

Causesvishnu1$Causesvishnu1$Causesvishnu1$Causes
The cause of colic is unknown. It may result from numerous contributing factors. While a number of causes have been explored, it's difficult for researchers to account for all the important features, such as why it usually begins late in the first month of life, how it varies among infants, why it happens at certain times of day and why it resolves on its own in time.

WASHvishnu1$YOURvishnu1$HANDS• Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.Babies often urinate more than 20 times a day. Hence, it is important to understand that you may need to change the diaper every 2 to 3 hours. While it may get taxing at times, remember that not changing the diaper on time may cause rashes and irritate the skin of your baby's bums.While every baby is different, research shows that the average American baby goes through six to 10 diapers a day. The kicker? The five-diaper-a-day number is an average over three years of diapering—and the diaper habits of a 2-month-old is different from, say, a 12-month-old.Regardless of the kind of diapers you use (reusables or disposables), diapering should be every 3 hours (more or less). This means 6 or 7 diapers a day which is average for a bigger baby, newborns might need slightly more (before their digestion fully develops at approx. 2 months, newborns usually poop after every feeding).vishnu1$It is not safe to have the baby in diapers for 24 hours but recommendations say that you need to have open air time for six to eight hours every day. Whenever you are changing diapers, give 15-20 minutes of open air time to let the skin dry on its own.A good rule of thumb is to change your baby's diaper after each feeding and before and after each nap, or about every 2 hours during the day.vishnu1$Safe and healthy hygiene habits are important for all ages, but they are especially important in settings with children who are in diapers and are very young. Maintaining safe diapering and infant feeding practices is essential to reduce the spread of germs and prevent children and caregivers from getting sick.vishnu1$Huggies diapers have a higher leak rate than competing brands, despite being built with more absorbent material. Pampers diapers are more absorbent and successfully stop leaks.vishnu1$Protect yourself and your children from germs by following these diapering steps.

Wash Your Hands: washing hands after diapering - Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.vishnu1$Use a comfortable and absorbent diaper to control the moisture and prevent diaper rashes. It is highly recommended to change your baby’s diaper every 2 to 4 hours as a soiled diaper for prolonged period can increase the chances of catching infections or causing rashes. Cleaning the diaper area with an alcohol-free wipe and ensuring the area is dry is also important. A mild diaper cream can be applied, if necessary, but the fastest way for the rash to heal is to keep it dry.vishnu1$Please check the size closely because appropriate diaper size is important. If the diaper is too small, then it can create rashes, marks and irritation. If the diaper is too big, then it may leak easily due to poor fitting.vishnu1$Picking the right diaper is an important task so as to ensure your baby is at the right comfort level throughout the day and their hygiene needs are taken care of.vishnu1$Opting for the appropriate diaper size is crucial and should be chosen wisely. If the diaper is too small, it can cause rashes, scratches, and irritation. If the diaper is too large, then it may leak easily due to poor fitting.vishnu1$Try a super absorbent diaper so it can absorb multiple wettings and ensures maximum protection from built-up dampness thus prevent rashes.vishnu1$Select a soft and breathable diaper that is lightweight and does not restrict baby’s movements. Super Cute’s offers India’s first Ultra-Thin baby diapers that are extremely comfortable and soothing for the baby’s skin.vishnu1$Hygiene and cleanliness are a priority when it comes to baby care and changing diapers in order to keep away all the bacteria and germs. Start by using a surface disinfectant and wiping the changing table so the surface is clean enough to change baby’s diaper. Gather your supply of one or two clean diapers, a washcloth or wipes, and a changing sheet.Ensure you wash your hands thoroughly, then remove the soiled diaper and carefully give your baby a good clean with a mild wipe or wet washcloth. When cleaning a girl, ensure you wipe front to back and for boys its back to front and properly dry the folds in the skin to prevent infection. In case of a diaper rash, use cotton balls, warm water, and a towel, and apply a mild diaper rash cream or baby powder and lotion can optionally be used too.vishnu1$Disposing diapers correctly: Soiled diapers need to be correctly cleaned and disposed to maintain a hygienic environment. If possible, put the diaper content into the toilet before disposing it. Fold the diaper and reseal the adhesive tapes to hold it in place, it can also be wrap in old newspaper and then disposed. Empty the garbage regularly in order to reduce smell and prevent the growth of bacteria. Remember to wash your hands after you dispose the diaper.vishnu1$Four signs it’s time to change your baby’s diapervishnu1$Suggested ad (Pampers)
Babies are notoriously tight-lipped, but just because they won’t tell you how they’re feeling verbally, doesn’t mean they won’t show you. Here are a few ways to tell that your baby is in dire need of a diaper change.
That mischievous facevishnu1$That mischievous face
You know that surprised, scrunched-up face people make when they’re eating something really sour? That’s what babies often look like when they’re pooping. Every baby’s “wet diaper face” is different, but once you learn what your baby’s looks like, you can intervene and get them clean, dry, and comfy sooner.vishnu1$An all too familiar smellvishnu1$An all too familiar smell
There are some smells that are loved by just about everyone, like freshly baked cookies, a long anticipated rainfall, and the first lilacs of spring. And then there are a few smells that are pretty universally feared, like dirty diapers.vishnu1$Some diapers contain perfumes, scented lotions, or other odor eaters that can actually make it hard to tell when it’s time for a change. Diapers that provide a scent light enough to temper the power of the your baby’s mess, but still allow their scent to waft, like Pampers Swaddlers, are ideal.vishnu1$A helping handvishnu1$A helping handvishnu1$A diaper that’s wet to the touch, or that has soaked through to your baby’s clothes, is pretty obvious. Hopefully, you’ll have an awesome diaper that keeps your baby (and the outside of their diaper) dry and comfortable.vishnu1$One way to find out whether a diaper is full, without having to actually feel inside of it, is to hold your hand over the front of your baby’s diaper and jiggle it a teensy bit to see if it moves. A Pampers Swaddlers diaper has absorbing gel inside of it, and with its soft and stretchy sides a full diaper should feel like it has wiggly jelly inside of it.vishnu1$Say yes to the techvishnu1$Say yes to the tech

Some women who give birth in the facility will spend time there following childbirth. WHO recommends that a women not be discharged before 24 hours after birth. Regardless of the place of birth, it is important that someone accompanies the woman and newborn for the first 24 hours after birth to respond to any changes in her or her baby's condition. Many complications can occur in the first 24 hours. Following childbirth at home, it is important that the mother and baby receive a postnatal examination as early as possible, preferably within 24 hours of birth. If the birth was at a facility, mother and baby should receive a postnatal examination before discharge.vishnu1$SCHEDULE OF POSTNATAL VISITS FOR MOTHER AND NEWBORN: First visit (could be a home visit) within 1 week, preferably on day 3. Second visit 7-14 days after birth.Third visit 4-6 weeks after birth.when should you start pumping breast milk :vishnu1$Some new moms start pumping breast milk right after their baby is born — in the hospital or birthing center — to help initiate breastfeeding or to encourage their milk supply. It’s particularly important to get an early start on pumping if you’re unable to nurse your baby from birth — if your baby is premature, for instance, or has special needs.vishnu1$Other new moms will wait a few weeks before they start pumping. In the early days of breastfeeding, there is often precious little time between nursing sessions to pump, and lactation experts advise holding off on giving a bottle until breastfeeding is well established. (Plenty of babies, however, go back and forth between bottle and breast from day one, so do what works best for you and your family.)vishnu1$By the time baby is 4 to 6 weeks old, breastfeeding should be well-established, and you’ll likely have enough time between feeding sessions to pump extra milk that can be stored for later use. If you’re planning to go back to work, start pumping two to three weeks beforehand to get the hang of it and build up a stockpile of milk.vishnu1$A few steps at the start of each pumping session can help ensure that you produce the most milk for your pumping buck.vishnu1$First, always thoroughly wash your hands with soap and warm water before starting.
Get relaxed. Find a comfortable, quiet spot to sit and relax as much as possible: take some deep breaths, do a five-minute meditation, do some yoga stretches.vishnu1$Encourage let-down. A soft breast massage or warm compress can get your breasts ready for let-down.vishnu1$Hold your baby close — in person, or in your imagination. If your baby is close by, a quick cuddle could help launch letdown (as long as she doesn't mind being this close to milk she’s not about to have). Away from home? Look at a photo of your baby, listen to a recording of her sounds or close your eyes and imagine her smell, her feel in your arms and her blissfully nursing face.vishnu1$Create a good seal. You might find that it helps to moisten the flange with water to ensure a good seal.vishnu1$Get centered. Center the nipple in the middle of the flange before starting the pump.vishnu1$Prime the pump. Most electric pumps will begin with a letdown phase — shorter, faster bursts of suction that mimic the initial suckling your baby would do in order to stimulate letdown. It will take a few minutes until letdown happens and before then you’ll only get drops to a slow trickle of milk. After a few minutes (around the time letdown happens) the pump will switch into regular mode.vishnu1$Don’t default to the highest level of suction. You’ll want to start at a low suction and increase it when the milk starts flowing (but only to your level of comfort — pumping shouldn’t hurt and a higher suction doesn’t mean more milk!).vishnu1$If you’re trying to build up your milk supply, pump in between nursing sessions when you’re with your baby. If you're pumping at work to replace feedings you’re missing, try to pump on the same schedule as your baby's feedings back at home so you keep your milk supply going strong and aligned with baby’s demand, usually every three to four hours.vishnu1$Aim to spend 15 to 20 minutes hooked up to the pump to net a good amount of breast milk (some women will need 30 minutes or more with the pump, especially in the early days). Pump until the milk starts slowing down and your breasts feel well-drained. Be sure to clean the breast flanges after every use.vishnu1$It takes about the same time to pump milk as it does to breastfeed. With practice, you may be able to pump in as little as 10 to 15 minutes. While you are at work, try to pump as often as your baby usually feeds. This may be every 3 to 4 hours for 15 minutes each time. To keep up your milk supply, give your baby extra feedings when you are together. You also can pump right after your baby feeds to help your breasts make more milk.vishnu1$There are a couple of ways you can store breast milk. You can use a plastic or glass bottle with a sealable top. Or you can use a sterile, sealable bag. Store your breast milk in the amount your baby consumes in a feeding. This way, you don’t waste any milk. For example, if your baby eats 4 ounces in a feeding, put 4 ounces of breast milk in the storage container. Always put a date on the container of breast milk so you know how long to keep it.vishnu1$Store your pumped breast milk in a refrigerator or cooler with ice as soon as possible. You also can freeze the milk if you aren’t going to use it right away.vishnu1$The life of breast milk varies based on how it is stored.
At room temperature (less than 77°F), it lasts up to 6 hours.
In a cooler with ice packs, it lasts up to 24 hours.
In the refrigerator, it lasts for 3 to 8 days.vishnu1$In the freezer, it lasts up to 6 months.vishnu1$Stored breast milk can vary in color. It can be bluish, yellowish, or brownish. It is normal for breast milk to separate (the fatty part of the milk goes to the top). Shake the bottle or sealed bag and the fat should go back into the milk. If it does not, then the breast milk may be bad. You should smell the milk before feeding it to your baby. Bad milk smells sour. If you still aren’t sure, try tasting the milk. If it tastes sour, then it is bad and needs to be thrown away.vishnu1$If you choose to freeze breast milk, you need to thaw it before giving it to your baby. There are 2 ways you can thaw the milk.vishnu1$Put the container of milk in warm water. Swirl the container around in the water until the milk thaws.vishnu1$Put the container of milk in the refrigerator the day before it is to be used.vishnu1$Thawed breast milk can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours, but it should not be refrozen. Do not use hot water to thaw breast milk. The milk could get too hot and burn your baby’s mouth. Do not thaw frozen breast milk in a microwave. This can damage valuable proteins in breast milk.vishnu1$You may not get much milk when you first start pumping. This will change as you continue to pump regularly. Your breasts will begin to make more milk. The more often you pump, the more milk your breasts make. Drink lots of fluids to stay hydrated. This will also help your milk supply.vishnu1$If you plan to pump when you return to work, start practicing 1 or 2 weeks in advance. This helps you learn how your pump works. You can pump right after your baby eats or between feedings. Or you may prefer to pump from one breast while you feed your baby from the other.Starting at home also helps you build a collection of breast milk. You can store it for your baby’s feedings when you return to work.vishnu1$Once you’re ready to start breast pumping, there are a few things you need to know. If you have a full-term, healthy, breastfeeding baby, you can wait a few weeks to start pumping and storing breast milk. If your baby is preterm or ill and cannot breastfeed yet, or if you have chosen to exclusively pump, pump as soon as you can after birth, preferably within one to six hours of delivery.vishnu1$If you’re primarily breastfeeding:vishnu1$If you’re primarily breastfeeding:
Pump in the morning. Many moms get the most milk first thing in the morning.
Pump between breastfeeding, either 30-60 minutes after nursing or at least one hour before breastfeeding. This should leave plenty of milk for your baby at your next feeding.
If your baby wants to breastfeed right after breast pumping, let them! Some babies are patient and will just feed longer to get the milk they need.

Plan to pump 8-10 times in a 24 hour period. Full milk production is typically 25-35 oz. (750-1,035 mL) per 24 hours.
Once you have reached full milk production, maintain a schedule that continues producing about 25-35oz of breastmilk in a 24 hour period.
Each mom and baby are different, plan your pumping sessions around what works best for the two of you.

Similar to a baby nursing at the breast, start out with high speed and low suction until you see milk flow (let-down), then adjust speed to medium and increase suction based on comfort level.
Once milk flow decreases, increase speed to high until the next let-down, then decrease to medium speed.vishnu1$Once milk flow decreases, increase speed to high until the next let-down, then decrease to medium speed.  
Keep going! You’ll find pumping gets quicker and easier with practice.vishnu1$How much milk you should expect to pump will vary depending on factors such as your baby’s age, time since last feeding or pumping, time of day, pump type, how much practice you’ve had with your pump, and whether you’re relaxed or stressed.
If you’re primarily breastfeeding, on average, you can expect:
More milk production in the morning hours .vishnu1$If you’re primarily breastfeeding, on average, you can expect:
More milk production in the morning hours .
Volumes gradually decreasing during the day into the evening.vishnu1$Breast milk volumes are dependent on many variables and each breast may produce different volumes.vishnu1$If you’re exclusively pumping, on average, you should try maintain full milk production of about 25-35 oz. (750-1,035 mL) per 24 hours.  It may take some time to achieve this target, do not worry about hitting this on day one!vishnu1$Babies may take more milk from the bottle than when breastfeeding. The faster, steadier flow of the bottle causes some babies to take more than they need. A slow-flow bottle may help prevent overfeeding.vishnu1$If you’re pumping because your baby is preterm or too sick to breastfeed, or because you have chosen to exclusively pump, follow these tips to reach and maintain full milk production. Pumping often to drain the breast completely sends a signal to the body to produce more milk. The more often you drain your breasts the more milk they will make.vishnu1$From Birth to Day 4
If you can, start pumping within six hours after birth.
Use a multi-user pump to initiate and maintain milk supply.vishnu1$Expect to pump just a little colostrum (the first milk) at first.
As soon as possible, pump 8-10 times every 24 hours. This is how many times each day your baby would typically feed from the breast.  In most cases, the more times each day you pump, the more milk you make. The reverse is true, too. Pumping  fewer times will produce less milk.vishnu1$Double pump (pump both breasts at once); this saves time and may boost production more quickly.vishnu1$Pump at least 10-20 minutes, until your milk comes in on Day 3 or 4. Then, hand express any remaining milk. Remove and place the breast flange under your breast to collect the milk you hand express. (The hand expression helps to better drain your breast, and drained breasts make milk faster.)vishnu1$To help establish milk supply, pump at least twice between 1 to 6am. In early morning hours milk- making hormone levels increase and taking advantage of this will increase your milk production.vishnu1$From Day 4 to Full Production
When your milk increases from drops to ounces on about day 4, make these changes:
Pump longer, two minutes after the last drop of milk or until your breasts are softened/no longer feel full.
Focus on the total number of pumpings each day (8-10 times per 24 hours) rather than the time between pumpings (every 2-3 hours).vishnu1$Focus on the total number of pumpings each day (8-10 times per 24 hours) rather than the time between pumpings (every 2-3 hours).
Don’t allow more than one five-hour period to pass without pumping during your baby’s first two weeks of life.vishnu1$Many moms find it easier to focus on their daily total rather than pumping at a set time each day. This daily total also seems to be most important to your milk production.
When you reach 25-35 oz. (750-1,050 mL) per baby per 24 hour period, you’ve met your goal. Most moms can then pump fewer times each day and maintain production. At this stage:vishnu1$When you reach 25-35 oz. (750-1,050 mL) per baby per 24 hour period, you’ve met your goal. Most moms can then pump fewer times each day and maintain production. At this stage:
Maintain a schedule that continues producing approximately 25-35oz of breastmilk in a 24 hour period.vishnu1$While maintaining your optimal production of milk, you can try and sleep more. Once full production is developed, many moms pump right before bed and first thing in the morning. See if you can do this without too much breast fullness or a decrease in milk production.vishnu1$Pump for a shorter period of time. For many moms, 10-15 minutes of pumping is long enough.vishnu1$Once a week, add up the milk you pump in a 24-hour period. Write it down and compare your totals each week. You’ll know right away if your production drops.
f you need to boost milk production, the sooner you work on it, the faster you’ll see results. Some ideas to try are:

When you decide to wean from the pump, remember the safest and most comfortable weaning is almost always a gradual one. There are a couple of ways to wean from the pump:vishnu1$Drop one daily pumping. Give your body two to three days to adjust. Then drop another daily pumping. Leave your first and last daily pumpings until the end. Repeat until you’re fully weaned from the pump.vishnu1$Keep the number of pumpings the same but pump for a shorter period of time. For example, if you were getting 4 oz. (120 mL) at each pumping, stop after 3 oz. (90 mL). Give your body two to three days to adjust and then do it again. Repeat until you no longer feel the need to pump.vishnu1$While weaning, if your breasts ever feel full, pump just long enough to make yourself comfortable. Letting your breasts stay too full puts you at risk for pain and infection.vishnu1$Power pumping boosts your milk supply by mimicking a baby's “cluster feeding,” a term for a period during which your baby feeds more frequently than usual (usually because of a growth spurt). Both are thought to ramp up the production of prolactin, a hormone that stimulates breast milk production.vishnu1$You can do power pumping instead of a feeding session (for example, you’re at work or otherwise away from your baby for a few hours). Otherwise, do it right after a breastfeeding session. Ideally, your power pumping session should last an hour.
A power pump schedule might look like this:vishnu1$A power pump schedule might look like this:
Pump for 20 minutes
Rest for 10 minutes
Pump for 10 miinutes
Rest for 10 minutes
Pump for 10 minutes to finish the hourvishnu1$Pump for 10 minutes to finish the hour
If you don’t have a full hour, then aim for two 30-minute sessions where you pump for 10 minutes, rest for five, pump for five, rest for five and then pump for another five. Then pump or nurse as usual the rest of the day.vishnu1$It will take a few days for your milk supply to respond to this increased demand: some moms see an increase within three days, while others will need to power pump for a week before seeing results.vishnu1$There are many reasons why a mom would pump her breast milk, from relieving engorgement and boosting milk supply to collecting milk for feedings when you’re away from your little one (such as when you return to work).vishnu1$If you pump and store your milk, you can continue to give your baby the benefits that come from breast milk long after you’ve stopped nursing. And for moms who want to feed their babies breast milk but can’t nurse for some reason (poor latch, for instance, or low supply), pumping ensures they can still offer their baby that liquid gold.vishnu1$No matter the reason you do it, pumping has a number of benefits:vishnu1$You’ll be able to go back to work (or go out for the night, take a vacation or travel for business) and still give your baby breast milk.
You don’t have to be the only one responsible for feeding your little one — a partner or caregiver can help, too.vishnu1$Pumping allows you to build your milk supply even before baby needs more milk, thereby allowing you to store the extra for later down the road.vishnu1$Pumping gives you the opportunity to donate your extra milk to moms who can’t breastfeed their babies themselves but want to give their little ones the benefits of breast milk.vishnu1$For most women, there usually comes a day (or night) where they need to be away from their baby, whether it’s for work, school, travel or just out for an evening. Consider it the law of busy motherhood: your baby and breasts aren’t always at the same place at the same time. You still may nurse baby, say, in the mornings before work, and evenings and weekends when you’re home, but she gets pumped breast milk for those times that you’re not around.vishnu1$Some women, however, have no choice but to pump exclusively, because despite all their best efforts, they can’t nurse due to circumstances such as the baby has trouble latching. In this case, you may opt to pump exclusively, otherwise known as “EPing."vishnu1$If you do decide to EP (and kudos to you, it’s no small feat!) then you’ll need to invest in a good double electric pump, which saves you time and also is the most effective way to pump up your milk supply. Experts also recommend trying to mimic a newborn baby’s schedule as much as possible, at least at the beginning. That can be up to eight to 12 times in a 24-hour day, or every two to three hours for 15-20 minutes at a time.vishnu1$As your milk supply becomes more established, you may find that you can space out the pumping for longer, at least at night.vishnu1$Cleaning your pump after each use is important to ensure germs don’t multiply and harm your little one. So be sure to wash all the pump parts that have come into contact with the breast or breast milk with liquid soap and hot water, scrubbing them with a cleaning brush and rinsing under running water.When washing by hand, be sure to use a clean wash basin — not the kitchen sink — that is only used for washing infant feeding equipment, and do not place the components of the pump in the sink. Air-dry and put the parts away only when they are completely dry. If your baby is less than 3 months or, born prematurely, or has a weakened immune system, sanitize daily.If your breast pumps parts are dishwasher-safe, place them in the top rack of a dishwasher and put it on a hot water and heated drying cycle.vishnu1$Maintaining your breast milk supply while pumping :vishnu1$Remember the rules of breastfeeding supply and demand: The more demand there is (in this case in the form of pumping), the more supply (in the form of breast milk) there will be. Which means that if you’re looking to maintain your milk supply you should be pumping at the same rate that your baby would be feeding directly from you, making sure your breasts are well drained at each session.vishnu1$A few more strategies that can help you maintain your milk supply while pumping:vishnu1$Relax. When you feel happy and relaxed, your body produces oxytocin, the hormone that signals that it’s time for the milk in your breasts to be released (letdown). Research has found that moms who listened to guided relaxation or soothing music while pumping had an increased pumping output — and that those who also looked at photos of their babies pumped even more.vishnu1$Get handsy. As you pump, compress and massage both breasts. Continue until milk flow slows to a trickle, then massage your breasts again, focusing on any areas that feel full. When no more milk is expressed via the pump, finish with a few minutes of hand expression, where you do intense breast compression on both breasts to ensure you’ve drained both as fully as possible.vishnu1$Take a look inside your medicine cabinet. Some types of birth control pills may decrease milk supply for some moms (consider a switch to another birth control method if that’s the case for you), as can the decongestant pseudoephedrine (found in Sudafed). If you’re congested, stick with non-medicinal methods to relieve the stuffiness, such as sinus rinses, steam or saline nasal sprays.vishnu1$Increasing your milk supply will take time, so don’t give up. Even dry pumps (when you pump but nothing comes out) sends a signal to your body that more milk is needed on tap, so it’s getting the work done even if there’s no output to show for it right away. Stick with it and you’ll see the results after a few days. Breast milk has antibacterial and antiviral elements.Depending on how long you breastfeed for, you’ll be lowering your baby’s risk of contracting colds and flu, ear and respiratory tract infections, sickness and diarrhoea. Scientists are even investigating breast milk’s potential for treating conditions ranging from conjunctivitis to cancer.vishnu1$Yes. Breastfeeding a sick baby gives her a great chance of a speedy recovery, as well as helping to comfort her. Your breast milk contains antibodies, white blood cells, stem cells and protective enzymes that fight infections and may help with healing.It also has a constantly adjusting balance of vitamins and nutrients, supporting her to get better as quickly as possible. And that means fewer sick days and visits to the doctor for both of you.vishnu1$“Breastfeeding provides everything your baby needs if she’s poorly – it’s her medicine as well as her food, fluid and comfort. It’s the best thing on the planet for her,” says Sarah Beeson, a UK-based health visitor and nurse.vishnu1$Amazingly, the composition of your breast milk changes when your baby is ill. If you’re exposed to a bacterial or viral infection, your body makes antibodies to combat it; these are then transferred to your baby through your milk. The levels of immunity-boosting cells, called leukocytes, in your milk also rise rapidly whenever your baby is unwell.vishnu1$And because breast milk is very easy to digest, it’s also the ideal food for babies with upset tummies.vishnu1$What if my baby seems too unwell to breastfeed?vishnu1$Sometimes when a baby is feeling really ill she may not have the appetite or energy to breastfeed. If you’re struggling to get her to feed, contact a healthcare professional, lactation consultant or breastfeeding specialist for advice to prevent her becoming dehydrated.They may advise you to express some milk to feed to your baby from a syringe, cup, or other method that you’ve found requires the least effort from her to drink from. Expressing when you would normally breastfeed will also keep your milk supply steady. If you have any concerns about your baby’s health or milk intake, always seek medical advice quickly.vishnu1$Can I still breastfeed when sick?vishnu1$It may be the last thing you feel like doing, but it’s best to keep breastfeeding through almost any common illness. If you have a cold or flu, fever, diarrhoea and vomiting, or mastitis, keep breastfeeding as normal. Your baby won’t catch the illness through your breast milk – in fact, it will contain antibodies to reduce her risk of getting the same bug.Not only is it safe, breastfeeding while sick is a good idea. Your baby is actually the person least likely to fall ill with your tummy upset or cold, as she has already been in close contact with you and is getting a daily dose of those protective antibodies from your milk.However, being sick and continuing to breastfeed can be extremely tiring. You’ll need to look after yourself so you can look after your baby. Keep your fluid levels up, eat when you can, and remember your body needs extra rest. Book a seat on your sofa and snuggle up with your baby for a few days, and ask family or friends to help with caring for your baby when possible so you can focus on recovering.Don’t worry about your breast milk supply – you will keep producing it. Just don’t stop breastfeeding abruptly as you’ll run the risk of getting mastitis.Good hygiene is important to minimise the risk of spreading the illness. Wash your hands with soap before and after feeding your baby, preparing and eating food, going to the toilet or changing nappies. Catch coughs and sneezes in a tissue, or in the crook of your elbow (not your hands) if you don’t have one with you, and always wash or sanitise your hands after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.vishnu1$Yes, it is still safe to breastfeed when you're feeling under the weather. Breast milk is still the healthiest source of nourishment for your baby while also providing your baby with antibodies and other immunological factors that will help keep your little one from getting sick. If you're too sick to breastfeed, expressed breast milk has the same benefits — just choose a healthy caregiver to feed your baby a bottle.vishnu1$Even if you're sick with COVID-19, you can still feed your baby breast milk, the latest recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Opens a new windowstate. If you're nursing, wash your hands well beforehand and wear a mask during feedings and any time you're within 6 feet of your baby. Increasing ventilation — by opening windows or turning on an air purifier — can also help prevent the virus from spreading. If you're pumping, wash those hands thoroughly before you start, and sanitize pump parts afterwards. If there's a healthy, vaccinated caregiver around, have that person handle feedings (with a mask on just in case).vishnu1$Does illness pass through breast milk: Cold and flu viruses do not pass through breast milk. Current evidence also suggests that the coronavirus also does not spread through breast milk, although moms with COVID-19 could transmit the virus to their babies through tiny airborne droplets when they cough, sneeze or talk.Certain more serious diseases such as HIV, HTLV-1 or brucellosis (a rare bacterial infection) do pass through breast milk, and you should talk to your doctor if you have been diagnosed with one of these illnesses.vishnu1$Medications that are considered safe for breastfeedingvishnu1$The most recent research indicates that most medications can be used safely during breastfeeding. These include (but are not limited to):
Acetaminophen (Tylenol)
Antacids (Maalox, Mylanta, Tums)

These include (but are not limited to): Cancer drugs , Certain epilepsy and seizure drugs, Ergots (used to treat migraines), Some beta blockers (used to treat irregular heartbeat and high blood pressure), And some medications should be avoided because they can reduce your milk supply, including (but not limited to): Pseudoephedrine, an antihistamine (Sudafed).vishnu1$The jury is still out on other medications — certain classes of antihistamines, for instance, or some antidepressants (although most are safe and treating postpartum depression may improve milk supply). And other medications are safe, but only if they're used sparingly and temporarily, such as narcotics for pain after a cesarean delivery, for instance. (Take only one tablet every six to eight hours maximum and watch for drowsiness in the baby.) Be sure to check with your baby's pediatrician for the most up-to-date info on what is and isn't safe.vishnu1$In some cases, a less-safe medication can safely be discontinued while a mom is breastfeeding, and in others, it's possible to find a safer substitute. When medication that isn't compatible with breastfeeding is needed short-term, nursing can be stopped temporarily (with breasts pumped and milk tossed — i.e. "pump and dump").vishnu1$You can also time the dosing for just after nursing or before your baby's longest sleep period (after you put her to bed for the night). As always, only take medicines — and that includes herbals and supplements — with your practitioner's approval.vishnu1$And if you do start a new doctor-approved medication, keep an eye on your baby for any unusual changes such as fussiness, rash or a change in eating or sleeping habits.vishnu1$It can, especially if you're not nursing or pumping as much as you normally would because you're not feeling up to snuff. But a drop in your milk supply is not likely to be permanent.
Being sick for a few days is just a small bump in the road when it comes to the long breastfeeding game, so continue to breastfeed if you feel up to it and pump as often as you can.vishnu1$Being sick for a few days is just a small bump in the road when it comes to the long breastfeeding game, so continue to breastfeed if you feel up to it and pump as often as you can.
There are a few basic precautions you can take to help keep your little one healthy:vishnu1$Ask for help. If you can arrange for a caregiver to help you care for your child while you're sick, it may be worth it. Let your partner or other family members help with diapering, playtime, bathtime and bedtime, and don't try to do it all yourself — you need rest to get well!vishnu1$Contain germs. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze, and wear a mask when holding your baby.vishnu1$Keep it clean. Wash your hands with warm soap and water after you cough or sneeze and especially if you're handling your breast pump. Wipe surfaces well to avoid the spread of disease.vishnu1$Be observant. If you notice that your child has a fever, respiratory issues including shallow, rapid or very slow breathing, or is less responsive than normal, consult with your doctor immediately.vishnu1$Don't forget that vaccines are one of the best ways to keep your whole household healthy. It's safe and recommended for pregnant and breastfeeding moms to get the flu vaccine and the COVID-19 vaccine.vishnu1$Babies older than 6 months also benefit greatly from getting an annual flu shot and the COVID-19 vaccine themselves. Everyone who's around your child — including partners, caregivers and family members — should get vaccinated too.vishnu1$Nearly every over-the-counter medication carries some warning to breastfeeding moms, so it's best to consult with a doctor before taking any sort of medicine.

Foods like oranges, tangerines, grapefruit, strawberries, melon, kiwi, mango, tomatoes, bell peppers, papaya, broccoli, red cabbage and spinach can boost your immune system.vishnu1$Amp up on zinc. Foods like turkey, beef, pork,eggs, yogurt, wheat germ and oatmeal are loaded with zinc and can also help boost immunity.vishnu1$Stay hydrated. Drink plenty of water or warm soothing beverages like tea and broth to stay hydrated while you're sick. This can help the illness to pass more quickly.
Switch on a humidifier. Dry air can make your cough worse. Using a cool-mist humidifier to keep the air in your home moist can help relieve coughing.vishnu1$Try saline. Keep your nasal passages moisturized with saline drops, sprays or rinses.vishnu1$Choose safe medications. Cold medications that are safe to take when you're nursing include many decongestants (other than those that contain pseudoephedrine) as well as pain relievers like acetaminophen and ibuprofen. Talk to your doctor before taking any cold medicine to see what he or she recommends.vishnu1$Breastfeed while you are sick: "Take good care of yourself and your breastfeeding baby, and feel better soon!"vishnu1$Most newborns eat every 2 to 3 hours, or 8 to 12 times every 24 hours. Babies might only take in half ounce per feeding for the first day or two of life, but after that will usually drink 1 to 2 ounces at each feeding. This amount increases to 2 to 3 ounces by 2 weeks of age.some signs that baby is hungry are : Licking lips,Sticking tongue out,Rooting (moving jaw and mouth or head in search of breast),Putting his/her hand to mouth repeatedly,Opening her mouth,Fussiness,Sucking on everything around.vishnu1$​In the first week after birth, babies should be eating no more than about 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 ml) per feed.During the first month, babies gradually eat more until they take 3 to 4 ounces (90 to 120 ml) per feed, amounting to 32 ounces per day. Formula-fed babies typically feed on a more regular schedule, such as every 3 or 4 hours. Breastfed babies usually take smaller, more frequent feedings than formula-fed infants.If your baby sleeps longer than 4 to 5 hours during the first few weeks after birth and starts missing feedings, wake them up and offer a bottle.vishnu1$By the end of the first month: Your baby will be up to at least 3 to 4 ounces (120 mL) per feeding, with a fairly predictable schedule of feedings about every 3 to 4 hours.By 6 months: Your baby will consume 6 to 8 ounces (180–240 mL) at each of 4 or 5 feedings in 24 hours.vishnu1$It is important to remember all babies are different―some like to snack more often, and others drink more at one time and go longer between feedings. However, most babies will drink more and go longer between feedings as they get bigger and their tummies can hold more milk:vishnu1$Most newborns eat every 2 to 3 hours, or 8 to 12 times every 24 hours. Babies might only take in half ounce per feeding for the first day or two of life, but after that will usually drink 1 to 2 ounces at each feeding. This amount increases to 2 to 3 ounces by 2 weeks of age.vishnu1$At about 2 months of age, babies usually take 4 to 5 ounces per feeding every 3 to 4 hours.
At 4 months, babies usually take 4 to 6 ounces per feeding.vishnu1$At 6 months, babies may be taking up to 8 ounces every 4 to 5 hours.vishnu1$Most babies will increase the amount of formula they drink by an average of 1 ounce each month before leveling off at about 7 to 8 ounces per feeding. Solid foods should be started at about 6 months old.Most babies will double their birth weight by 5 months of age and triple their birth weight by their first birthday. If your baby is having trouble gaining weight, don't wait too long between feeding―even if it means waking your baby. Be sure to talk with your pediatrician about how often and how much to feed your baby.vishnu1$Concerns about overfeeding or underfeeding your baby:vishnu1$Babies are usually pretty good at eating the right amount, but they can sometimes take in more than they need. Infants who are bottle feeding may be more likely to overfeed, because drinking from a bottle may take less effort than breastfeeding. Overfed babies can have stomach pains, gas, spit up or vomit and be at higher risk for obesity later in life. It's better to offer less, since you can always give more if your baby wants it. This also gives babies time to realize when they're full.If you are concerned your baby wants to eat all the time―even when he or she is full―talk with your pediatrician. Pacifiers may be used after feeding to help sooth healthy-weight babies who like to suck for comfort, rather than nutrition. For babies who are breastfed, it's best to wait to offer pacifiers until around 3 to 4 weeks of age, when breastfeeding is well-established.vishnu1$Formula feeding based on body weight:vishnu1$On average, your baby should take in about 2½ ounces (75 mL) of infant formula a day for every pound (453 g) of body weight. But they probably will regulate their intake from day to day to meet their own specific needs, so let them tell you when they've had enough. If they become fidgety or easily distracted during a feeding, they're probably finished. If they drain the bottle and continues smacking their lips, they might still be hungry.There are high and low limits, however. If your baby consistently seems to want more or less than this, discuss it with your pediatrician. Your baby should usually drink no more than an average of about 32 ounces (960 mL) of formula in 24 hours. Some babies have higher needs for sucking and may just want to suck on a pacifier after feeding.vishnu1$On-demand feedingvishnu1$Initially it is best to feed your formula-fed newborn a bottle on demand, or whenever they cry with hunger. As time passes, your baby will begin to develop a fairly regular timetable of their own. As you become familiar with their signals and needs, you'll be able to schedule their feedings around their routine.vishnu1$Eating & sleeping patterns:vishnu1$Between 2 and 4 months of age (or when the baby weighs more than 12 lb. [5.4 kg]), most formula-fed babies no longer need a middle-of-the-night feedings. They're consuming more during the day, and their sleeping patterns have become more regular (although this varies considerably from baby to baby). Their stomach capacity has increased, too, which means they may go longer between daytime feedings—occasionally up to 4 or 5 hours at a time.If your baby still seems to feed very frequently or consume larger amounts, try distracting them with play or with a pacifier. Sometimes patterns of obesity begin during infancy, so it is important not to overfeed your baby.vishnu1$Getting to know your baby's feeding needs:vishnu1$The most important thing to remember, whether you breastfeed or bottlefeed, is that your baby's feeding needs are unique. No book―or website―can tell you precisely how much or how often they need to be fed or exactly how you should handle them during feedings. You will discover these things for yourself as you and your baby get to know each other.Breastfeeding is a natural way for mothers to supply their infants with all the nutrition and food they need for the first months of life. It may also help mothers recover more quickly from childbirth.vishnu1$In the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) currently recommends: Infants should be fed breast milk exclusively for the first 6 months after birth.Exclusive breastfeeding means that the infant does not receive any additional foods (except vitamin D) or fluids unless medically recommended.After the first 6 months and until the infant is 1 year old, the AAP recommends that the mother continue breastfeeding while gradually introducing solid foods into the infant's diet.vishnu1$After 1 year, breastfeeding can be continued if mutually desired by the mother and her infant.The World Health Organization currently promotes as a global public health recommendation that: Infants be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months after birth to achieve optimal growth, development, and health.vishnu1$After the first 6 months, to meet their evolving nutritional requirements, infants should receive nutritionally adequate and safe complementary foods while breastfeeding continues for up to 2 years of age or beyond.vishnu1$Breastfeeding has both short- and long-term health benefits for mother and infant. For the baby, these benefits include:Reduced infections. There’s a correlation between babies who are breastfed and having fewer childhood infections, such as ear, respiratoryTrusted Source, and gutTrusted Source infections as well as fewer colds.vishnu1$Better immunity against viruses and bacteria. Breast milk contains immunoglobulinsTrusted Source, or antibodies, from the mother. These proteins help strengthen the infant’s immune system so it can defend itself.vishnu1$Reduced risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Breastfed babies have a lower risk for SIDS, both in the first month and first year of the baby’s life.vishnu1$A healthier weight. Children who are breastfed may have a lower rateTrusted Source of childhood obesity compared to formula-fed babies.
Lower risk of diabetes. Breastfeeding reduces a child’s risk for both type 1Trusted Source and type 2Trusted Source diabetes.vishnu1$Satisfying changing nutritional needs. Babies require different levels of nutrients at the various phases of year one. A mother’s milk supply will naturally changeTrusted Source with the baby’s needs.vishnu1$The benefits of breastfeeding aren’t for baby alone. Breastfeeding mothers may experience some benefits from breastfeeding as well. These benefits include:Improved recovery. Breastfeeding releases higher levels of oxytocin. This hormone can help improve uterine contractionsTrusted Source. That will also help the uterusTrusted Source return to its prepregnancy size.vishnu1$Losing pregnancy weight faster. Those who breastfeed exclusively may lose more weight postpartumTrusted Source than those who don’t breastfeed.vishnu1$Reduced risk of depression. Mothers may also reduceTrusted Source their risk for postpartum depression by breastfeeding their infants.vishnu1$Lower risk of some cancers. The longer a mother spends breastfeeding, the lowerTrusted Source their risk for breast and ovarian cancers.vishnu1$Lower rates of some medical conditions. Research shows those who breastfeed for one to two years during their lifetime also have a 10 to 50 percent lower risk of certain conditions, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol and triglycerides, arthritis, and high blood pressure. Formula is a nutritious alternative to breast milk for those who choose to use it or need to because of medical reasons.Baby formula sold in the United States is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. While formula doesn’t match natural breast milk completely.A baby’s body doesn’t process formula as quickly as it does breast milk. That may allow you or another caregiver more time between feedings.However, formula can be costly. Depending on the type and quantity your baby uses, a month’s supply could cost more than $100.Before your baby is born, your body will begin producing breast milk. It’s preparing you for the infant’s arrival and the nourishment you’ll need to give them right away.Your first feeding may be within a few hours of childbirth. That first breast milk is called colostrum. It’s a thick, yellow, sticky substance that’s rich with nutrients. It helps prime your baby’s gastrointestinal system for future feedings.A few short days after giving birth, your body will begin producing a different type of breast milk. This milk is also very rich in nutrients and will fully sustain your infant for their first months.Breastfeeding is a bonding exercise. You’ll learn your baby’s hunger cues and they’ll learn to respond to your body.vishnu1$How to get a good latch: Start by resting your baby in a comfortable breastfeeding position that’s facing you. If baby has to twist their neck at all, they may not breastfeed well.Uncover a breast from your bra or shirt. Gently stroke your baby’s lower lip with your nipple. Their mouth will naturally open wide, and their tongue will cup and lower into their mouth.Place your baby’s mouth directly onto your nipple. They’ll instinctually close and begin to draw.You’ll know your baby’s mouth is positioned correctly if you see their lips pursed outward and their mouth covers all of your nipple and most of your darker areola.If you experience any discomfort or pain, gently break the baby’s suction. Slide your pinkie between the corner of your baby’s mouth and your nipple. Push down. The latch will pop. Pull baby away.Before bringing baby back to your nipple, try to get them to open their mouth as wide as possible. Repeat the steps until the latch is comfortable and your baby is breastfeeding in a smooth, even rhythm.Establishing a good latch will help baby get adequate milk. It’ll prevent pain and discomfort for you too.If you continue to struggle with producing a strong latch, talk to your pediatrician or a lactation consultant. They are there to help you.How to manage sore nipples: Many moms experience pain and soreness in the first few days of breastfeeding. This is very common.What causes sore nipples while breastfeeding?vishnu1$Sore nipples are very common for breastfeeding women. Prevention is possible and treatment depends on what the cause is. The most common causes include:vishnu1$a baby not latching well
chafing
thrush
adapting to this new skillvishnu1$You might even have more than one cause of sore nipples.Is baby getting enough milk?vishnu1$With breastfeeding, it’s hard to know precisely how much milk your baby is getting with each feeding. Instead of trying to measure ounces, look for signs in other places:Your baby makes plenty of dirty diapers. Babies who are getting enough milk have 6 to 8 wet diapers per day.vishnu1$Your baby is gaining weight. After an initial weight drop in the first few days after delivery, your baby should begin steadily gaining weight. If the weight continues to fall, you may not be producing enough milk. Talk with your baby’s pediatrician or a lactation consultant if baby isn’t gaining weight.vishnu1$Your baby shows no signs of hunger. Babies who are fed are content. If your baby shows hunger cues more frequently, they may not be getting enough milk in each session.vishnu1$1-3 days age children wets 1-2 diapers and 1-2 pop diapers.4 days age children wets 4-6 diapers and 4 pop diapers.5-28 days age children wets 6+ diapers and 3+ pop diapers.A lactation consultant will likely come visit you in the hospital in your baby’s first 24 hours. These healthcare providers are trained to help mothers learn to breastfeed.They’ll watch you while breastfeeding, offering instruction and correction.They may help you understand what a good latch feels like. They can answer any questions you have too.Your insurance may cover a lactation consultant.vishnu1$Remember, breastfeeding is a learned skill.It takes time and practice.Breastfeeding may help reduceTrusted Source your risk of developing certain medical conditions later in life, including heart disease and diabetes. It may also relieve stress and help you feel more connected to your new baby. All good things.Plus, breast milk is chock-full of nourishing nutrients and protective compounds that are essential for your babys development. This is why 'breast milk is known as the “gold standard” for infant nutrition and is often referred to as liquid gold.With the exception of vitamin D, breast milk contains everything your baby needs for proper development during the first 6 months.vishnu1$"Research shows that breast milk is made up of 87 percent water, 3.8 percent fat, 1.0 percent protein, and 7 percent carbohydrate and provides 60 to 75 kcal/100ml".vishnu1$Breast milk changes during each feeding and throughout your lactation period, in order to meet the needs of your baby.At the beginning of a feeding, the milk is more watery and usually quenches the baby’s thirst. The milk that comes later (hindmilk) is thicker, higher in fat and more nutritious.In fact according to an older 2005 studyTrusted Source, this milk may contain 2 to 3 times as much fat as milk from the beginning of a feeding, and 7 to 11 more calories per ounce. Therefore, to get to the most nutritious milk, it’s important that your baby empties one breast before switching to the other.In fact, it’s estimated that your energy needs during breastfeeding increase by about 500 caloriesTrusted Source per day. The need for specific nutrients, including protein, vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, B12, selenium, and zinc go up as well.vishnu1$Here are some nutritious and delicious food choices to prioritize when breastfeeding:vishnu1$Fish and seafood: salmon, seaweed, shellfish, sardines
Meat and poultry: chicken, beef, lamb, pork, organ meats (such as liver)
Fruits and vegetables: berries, tomatoes, bell peppers, cabbage, kale, garlic, broccoli
Nuts and seeds: almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, hemp seeds, flaxseeds
Healthy fats: avocados, olive oil, coconut, eggs, full-fat yogurtvishnu1$Fiber-rich starches: potatoes, butternut squash, sweet potatoes, beans, lentils, oats, quinoa, buckwheat
Other foods: tofu, dark chocolate, kimchi, sauerkraut.vishnu1$Other foods: tofu, dark chocolate, kimchi, sauerkraut.

In this website you can find what nutriuents you need to take.vishnu1$Research suggests that approximately 1% of the caffeine a mother ingests is transferred to her breast milk. However, it can build up in your infant’s body over time.Consuming up to 300 mg of caffeine per day while breastfeeding appears to be safe for mothers and infants. Excess intake may lead to infant sleeping issues and restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, and rapid heartbeat in moms.The amount of caffeine in common beverages varies widely. Coffee, tea, sodas, hot chocolate, and energy drinks all contain caffeine.Caffeine content is affected by the type of coffee bean, roast style, how the coffee is prepared and the serving size.The average caffeine content of an 8-oz, brewed cup of coffee is 95 mg. A single espresso or espresso-based drink contains 63 mg, and decaf coffee contains about 3 mg of caffeine (on average).Coffee is high in antioxidants, and many studies show that it is good for your health.However, getting too much caffeine is linked to adverse effects like anxiety, sleep disruptions, heart palpitations and restlessness (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).Consuming 400–600 mg/day of caffeine is generally not associated with adverse effects in most people. This is about 6 mg/kg (3 mg/lb) of body weight, or 4–6 average cups of coffee per day (16Trusted Source).vishnu1$The things you eat and drink can be transferred to your baby through your milk. Women who are breast-feeding are advised to avoid alcohol, caffeine, and certain medications.Caffeine can stay in your system for five to 20 hours. If you are taking medications, have higher body fat, or other medical problems, it may stick around longer.Caffeine can stay in a newborn’s system much longer than an adult’s system, so you could be dealing with fussiness and sleep problems for quite some time.vishnu1$Green tea certainly doesn’t have as much caffeine as coffee, and you can even get caffeine-free varieties. An 8-ounce serving of regular green tea has about 24 to 45 mg, compared with 95 to 200 mg in brewed coffee.In general, you can drink one to three cups of green tea a day and not have any harmful effects on your newborn.“It’s recommended not to consume more than 300 mg of caffeine a day if you’re breast-feeding.”According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), breast milk contains less than 1 percent of the caffeine taken in by the mom. If you’re not drinking more than three cups, you should be OK.Some other low- to caffeine-free teas that are safe to drink while breast-feeding are:vishnu1$white teavishnu1$chamomile tea
ginger tea
peppermint tea
dandelion
rose hips
“If you feel as though you have consumed something unsafe for your baby, it’s best to ‘pump and dump’ for 24 hours. After 24 hours, you can safely resume breast-feeding,”.Pump and dump refers to pumping your milk supply and getting rid of it without feeding your baby. This way, you work through the milk that might have too much caffeine.vishnu1$“Alcohol decreases milk production, with 5 drinks or more decreasing milk letdown and disrupting nursing until maternal alcohol levels decrease,”.Alcohol while breastfeedingvishnu1$It’s okay to have 1 drink a day, but long-term or heavy drinking can impact your baby.
Wait 2 to 2.5 hours after each drink before breastfeeding.
Don’t breastfeed 30 to 60 minutes after an alcoholic beverage, as that’s when the highest alcohol levels in milk occur.vishnu1$Keep in mind that food delays the time of peak milk alcohol levels.
There’s no need to pump and dump.
Alcohol may decrease your milk supply.
THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) — the psychoactive compound found in the marijuana plant — interacts with breast milk :
Small amounts of THC do make it into breast milk, a small study showed.vishnu1$THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) — the psychoactive compound found in the marijuana plant — interacts with breast milk :
Small amounts of THC do make it into breast milk, a small study showed.
We don’t know the full impact on babies who are exposed to THC, though older studies show potential harm exists.vishnu1$There haven’t been enough studies done, so to be safe, avoid using high-THC cannabis while breastfeeding.vishnu1$CBD (cannabidiol) is a popular, nonpsychoactive treatment for maladies from pain and digestive issues to mental health issues like depression and anxiety.CBD use during breastfeeding isn’t proven to be safe, but like THC, more studies are needed to know what risks are possible.
It’s best to talk to your healthcare provider before deciding.vishnu1$Pain pills while breastfeeding:Opioids taken by a mom show up in breast milk.It’s still unclear whether or not it’s safe to take certain levels of opioids while breastfeeding.Talk to your doctor to help make a decision.vishnu1$You can use galactagogues to try to boost your milk supply. Some foods have these natural milk boosters. Many over-the-counter breastfeeding supplements contain natural milk boosters, such as fenugreek, milk thistle, and malunggay.vishnu1$Depending on what type of freezer you use, frozen breast milk may stay good for three months to a yearTrusted Source.Studies have shown that freezing milk doesn’t damage important macronutrients and other benefits, like antibodies, for at least nine months or longer. To feed previously frozen milk to your baby, simply thaw the milk and serve cool or warm to body temperature.You can thaw frozen breast milk by placing it in the refrigerator overnight or for approximately 12 hours. From there, you can store thawed breast milk in your refrigerator for up to 24 hours. After that, the milk might be more apt to grow bacteria.To warm milk that’s been thawed in the refrigerator, place it under warm running water until it reaches body temperature. Be sure to test the milk before offering it to your baby to ensure it won’t burn their mouth. You can also swirl the milk to mix in the cream of the milk that rises during freezing.Any milk used to feed your baby throughout the day should be discarded after the feeding or within one or two hours.Once milk has been thawed using this method, it should be used within two hours.vishnu1$Refer "https://www.healthline.com/health/parenting/how-to-thaw-breast-milk" for how to Safely Store, Use, and Thaw Frozen Breast Milk.vishnu1$Refer "https://www.healthline.com/health/parenting/breastfeeding" for Guide to Breastfeeding: Benefits, How to, Diet, and More.vishnu1$The meaning of wean is to start feeding (a child or young animal) food other than its mother's milk.How to wean baby off of breastfeedingvishnu1$Leading healthcare organizations, like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), AAP, and WHO, recommend exclusively breastfeeding for the first six months of a baby’s life.After that point, you can begin introducing solid foods. That will begin to reduce how much breastfeeding you do.ACOG and AAP say supplemental breastfeeding is good for the first full year. WHO suggests you can practice extended breastfeeding and breastfeed your baby up to age 2.But when to stop breastfeeding is a personal decision. Do what works best for you and your family.Weaning your baby is a process, but it can be accomplished. You can follow your baby’s lead and wean naturally as they begin eating other foods and drinking cow’s milk, juice, or other beverages.Or you can take charge and decide when the weaning process will begin. This may be met with some resistance, but timing and persistence can help you overcome any obstacle.Start slowly. Gradually reduce the amount of breastfeeding. This helps your baby adjust to scaled-back feedings. Your breasts will naturally stop producing as much milk too.A daytime feeding may be easiest to skip at first. You can keep your child busy during that normal feeding period by finding an activity to do or being away from the house.Avoid normal breastfeeding spots during this period. The familiar scenes may conjure up cravings for your baby. By steering you and baby away from those chairs, beds, or other spots, you can help change the habit.Newborns generally sleep 12 to 16 hours in a 24-hour period and do not know the difference between day and night.Your newborn will sleep a lot from 0 - 3 months. Newborns need regular feeding, so they usually sleep in short periods. Newborns sleep in short bursts, known as sleep cycles which are usually around 20 to 50 minutes long. In the first 3 months of life, babies cry a lot – it is their main way of communicating.From approximately 2 weeks to 3-4 months of age, newborns go through a stage of increased crying, which will be at its worst at 6-8 weeks of age.Sleep cycles means your newborn sleeps many times in the day and night and for short amounts of time. For example, one sleep cycle goes for 20 - 50 minutes.In one sleep cycle there is active sleep - Active sleep means your newborn moves around or makes noises. quiet sleep - Quiet sleep means your newborn stays still and breathes deeper.The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recommends a total sleep duration of 14 to 17 hours a day from birth to three months; 12 to 15 hours a day from four to 11 months; and 11 to 14 hours a day for infants aged one to two years. Sleep problems during infancy have been shown to be associated with subsequent sleep problems during early childhood, which in turn are linked to behavioural and learning problems.vishnu1$Your newborn will wake up many times in the day and night. Your baby will start to learn sleep rhythms after 3 months of age. Sleep rhythms means your newborn will start to learn when it is day and night. To help your newborn learn a sleep rhythm, you can play gently in the day when it is light , make it dark and quiet at night when it is time to sleep.vishnu1$Babies go through several sleeping patterns and stages as they grow and develop. Here are some common sleeping patterns observed in babies:vishnu1$Newborns (0-3 months): Newborn babies tend to sleep for most of the day, typically 14-17 hours in a 24-hour period. However, their sleep is usually fragmented into short periods, ranging from a few minutes to a few hours. They have no set sleep-wake cycles and may wake frequently for feeding, diaper changes, or comfort.vishnu1$Infants (3-6 months): As infants grow, they start developing more regular sleep patterns. They may sleep for 13-15 hours a day, including nighttime sleep and naps. During this stage, they begin to develop longer periods of consolidated nighttime sleep and may sleep for 6-8 hours at a stretch. Daytime naps usually decrease to 2-3 naps per day.vishnu1$Older infants (6-12 months): By this stage, babies typically sleep for around 12-14 hours a day, with nighttime sleep becoming more continuous. Most infants can sleep through the night without needing a feeding. They may have 2-3 daytime naps, with each nap lasting around 1-2 hours.vishnu1$Toddlerhood (1-3 years): Toddlers generally require around 11-14 hours of sleep, including nighttime sleep and a single daytime nap. Nighttime sleep becomes more consistent, usually lasting 10-12 hours. Daytime naps reduce to one nap, usually occurring in the afternoon and lasting 1-3 hours.vishnu1$It's important to note that every baby is unique, and individual sleep patterns can vary. Some babies may require more or less sleep than the average ranges mentioned above. Additionally, sleep patterns can be influenced by various factors such as growth spurts, developmental milestones, teething, illness, and environmental factors.vishnu1$Establishing a consistent sleep routine, creating a conducive sleep environment, and promoting healthy sleep habits can help babies develop good sleeping patterns and promote better sleep for both the baby and caregivers.vishnu1$It is normal for your newborn to cry a lot. Crying is how newborns can tell you something. Many newborns can cry for around 3 hours per day. Sometimes you will not know why your newborn cries or what they want to tell you. It is ok if you find it hard to stop your newborn from crying.vishnu1$Feeding can help newborns sleep.vishnu1$Feeding can help newborns sleep.
Feeding means you give your newborn breastmilk or formula. Sleep will not change if your newborn has breast milk or formula. Your newborn will need to be fed many times in the day and night. Every newborn feeds in a different way. You will work out the best way to feed your newborn in the day and night.vishnu1$*********************** Importance of sleep ***************************************vishnu1$Infant sleep plays an important role in a child's development, including cognition and physical growth – it's associated with overall cognitive development, as well as specific cognitive functions such as memory, language and executive function.vishnu1$The importance of slumbervishnu1$Babies are born with no established circadian rhythm and it will be developed only when they are about three to four months old. This explains why your child may sleep in the day and not at night (much to your despair). Parents can help this process by exposing babies to natural light cues in the day, and similarly provide a dark environment at night. This helps junior to distinguish day (light) from night (dark).Sleep in the first year of life is imperative as it is an important period for maturation of sleep, with consolidation of nocturnal sleep and decrease in day sleep duration. Infant sleep plays an important role in a child’s development, including cognition and physical growth – it’s associated with overall cognitive development, as well as specific cognitive functions such as memory, language and executive function. Sufficient and quality sleep may favour optimal cognitive function in children because it helps with brain maturation and memory consolidation. Slow wave sleep – often referred to as deep sleep – plays an important role in memory consolidation, which may be important during early language acquisition.vishnu1$"Growth hormone is also released during slow wave sleep, contributing to gain in body length". Short sleep duration in infants have been reported to be linked to adiposity and obesity later in life.1,2 Sleep deprivation is associated with increased ghrelin (hunger hormone) and decreased leptin (satiety hormone), resulting in increased caloric intake leading to adiposity.vishnu1$Infant sleep plays an important role in their overall development and well-being. Sleep is crucial for babies as it supports their growth, physical health, brain development, and emotional well-being. The reasons why sleep is so important for babies.vishnu1$Growth Hormone Secretion: During deep sleep, infants produce growth hormones, which are essential for their physical growth and development. These hormones promote the growth of bones, muscles, and tissues. Sufficient sleep helps support optimal growth in babies.vishnu1$Brain Development: Sleep is closely linked to brain development in infants. During sleep, the brain consolidates and processes the information and experiences acquired during wakefulness. It is a critical time for the formation of neural connections, which strengthen memory, language skills, and executive functions.vishnu1$Memory Consolidation: Sleep plays a vital role in memory consolidation. It helps babies store and retain information they have learned throughout the day. During deep sleep, the brain processes and strengthens memories, allowing for better recall and learning in the future.vishnu1$Emotional Regulation: Adequate sleep is essential for promoting emotional well-being in babies. It helps regulate emotions, reduces irritability, and contributes to a positive mood. Sufficient sleep allows babies to handle daily challenges with improved emotional resilience.vishnu1$Immune System Function: Sleep is crucial for a healthy immune system. During sleep, the body produces cytokines, a type of protein that helps fight off infections, inflammation, and illness. Sufficient sleep strengthens the immune system and reduces the risk of infections and diseases in infants.vishnu1$Appetite and Weight Regulation: Sleep plays a role in regulating appetite and metabolism in babies. Lack of sleep can disrupt the balance of hormones involved in hunger and satiety, leading to increased appetite and potential weight gain. Sufficient sleep helps maintain a healthy appetite and supports proper weight management.vishnu1$Cognitive Function and Learning: Sleep is closely associated with cognitive function and learning in infants. It enhances attention, concentration, and problem-solving abilities. Good quality sleep allows babies to be more alert, focused, and receptive to new information and learning experiences.vishnu1$Restorative and Healing Processes: Sleep provides a time for the body to rest, repair, and heal. It allows the body to conserve energy, promote tissue growth and repair, and support overall physical well-being in infants.vishnu1$In conclusion, sleep is incredibly important for babies as it contributes to their growth, brain development, emotional well-being, physical health, and learning abilities. Establishing healthy sleep habits early on is crucial for optimal development and overall well-being. As caregivers, it is essential to prioritize and create a conducive sleep environment for babies, ensuring they get the sleep they need for healthy development.vishnu1$Full milk production is typically 25-35 oz. (750-1,035 mL) per 24 hours. Once you have reached full milk production, maintain a schedule that continues producing about 25-35oz of breastmilk in a 24 hour period. For the first 2 to 5 days after your baby is born, you will make a small amount of colostrum, which is all a healthy term baby needs. Colostrum is a thick, rich milk that is high in nutrients. Around day 3 through 5, your milk will come in. In an average fifteen to twenty minute breast milk pumping session, most moms express between . 5 ounces and four ounces of breast milk total. Each mom and baby are different, plan your pumping sessions around what works best for the two of you.Your milk supply depends on how often you nurse or pump your breasts. The more you breastfeed or pump, the more milk your body makes. So, if you seem to be producing less milk than usual, nurse your baby more often. You also can pump after nursing to help stimulate more milk production.vishnu1$Signs That a Breastfed Baby Is Being Well Nourishedvishnu1$Your baby nurses at least 8 to 16 times in 24 hours, or every 2 to 3 hours. Your baby may be fussy once or twice a day. At these times, he or she wants to nurse often for several hours before seeming full. This is called cluster feeding.
Your baby wets at least 6 cloth or 5 disposable diapers and has at least 1 bowel movement in 24 hours. This occurs by 1 week of age.vishnu1$You can hear your baby swallow milk while nursing or you can feel your baby swallow when lightly touching his or her throat.
Your breasts seem softer after nursing.vishnu1$Your breasts seem softer after nursing.
Your baby gains 4 to 8 ounces a week after the first week. There is no need to weigh your baby at home. Your baby’s doctor will do this for you. You may notice that your baby has outgrown his or her clothing.
Your baby has regained his/her birthweight by 10 to 14 days after birth.vishnu1$How fast babies gain weight, how many wet and dirty diapers they have, and how long they seem satisfied after nursing are good clues. A well nourished newborn should:vishnu1$Lose no more than 7% of birthweight in the first few days after birth before starting to gain weight again.
Have one or two bowel movements per day on days one and two, with blackish, tarry stools, and at least two stools that are beginning to appear greenish to yellow on days three and four.vishnu1$By five to seven days, your baby's stools should be yellow and loose, with small curds, and should number at least three to four per day. When your milk production increases, your baby will often produce stool with each feeding for the first month of life.vishnu1$Have six or more wet diapers​ per day, with nearly colorless or pale yellow urine, by five to seven days.
Seem satisfied and happy for an average of one to three hours between feedings​.
Factors Which Can Cause Your Milk Supply to Decreasevishnu1$Your baby feeds fewer than 8 to 16 times in 24 hours. Milk production is affected by how well the breast is drained.
Your baby has a very weak suck, or has an improper latch.vishnu1$Your baby has a very weak suck, or has an improper latch.
Giving bottles of formula or water after nursing. Most babies will suck on a bottle after nursing. This just means they need to suck. It does not mean they are still hungry. Babies cry or fuss for many reasons, such as being tired, bored, wet, hot or cold.vishnu1$Giving solid foods too early and/or before you breastfeed. Most babies do not need solid foods for the first 6 months if they are breastfeeding 8 to 16 times a day.vishnu1$Smoking can cause a decreased milk supply and interfere with the letdown reflex. Here are some things you should do:
Try to quit or cut down.
Smoke after nursing, not before.
Don’t smoke in the same room with your baby.vishnu1$Don’t smoke in the same room with your baby.vishnu1$Beginning birth control pills too soon can decrease your milk supply. Wait at least 6 weeks before taking birth control pills and then use only the mini-pill (Progestin). If you still notice a decrease in your milk supply, talk to your doctor about other birth control options. Other medications may also affect milk supply. Check with your doctor. (Refer to PI-682, Breastfeeding and Birth Control: You Have Options.)vishnu1$Mothers who are exhausted may notice a decrease in milk supply. To keep yourself from getting too tired:
Sleep or relax when your baby sleeps.vishnu1$Sleep or relax when your baby sleeps.
Eat balanced diet that includes high-protein food.
Drink when you are thirsty so that your urine is pale yellow in color. Both under and excessive over hydration can decrease milk supply.
Take an iron supplement if your healthcare provider says you are anemic.
Talk with your doctor or nurse midwife about the need for vitamin supplement.vishnu1$Accept help when it is offered.
Use nipple shields and pacifiers with caution.

If You Notice Your Milk Supply Is Low
You can increase your milk supply by:vishnu1$You can increase your milk supply by:vishnu1$Nursing your baby often. Nurse every 2 hours during the day and every 3 to 4 hours at night (at least 8 to 16 times in 24 hours). If your baby will not nurse, use a good quality double electric breast pump to increase milk production. Pumping after breastfeeding signals your body to produce more milk.vishnu1$Nurse your baby at least 15 minutes at each breast. Do not limit nursing time. If your baby falls asleep after one breast, wake him or her and offer the second breast. A few babies may benefit from nursing at one breast per feeding to increase the fat content of the feeding.

Hunger cues or signs that your baby is hungry:
A hungry baby often will cry. But it's best to watch for hunger cues before the baby starts crying, which is a late sign of hunger and can make it hard for them to settle down and eat.vishnu1$Some other typical hunger cues in babies:
Licking lips
Sticking tongue out
Rooting (moving jaw and mouth or head in search of breast)
Putting his/her hand to mouth repeatedly
Opening her mouth
Fussiness

It is important to realize, however, that every time your baby cries or sucks it is not necessarily because he or she is hungry. Babies suck not only for hunger, but also for comfort; it can be hard at first for parents to tell the difference. Sometimes, your baby just needs to be cuddled or changed.vishnu1$Newborns may nurse for up to 20 minutes or longer on one or both breasts. As babies get older and more skilled at breastfeeding, they may take about 5–10 minutes on each side.vishnu1$How do I know my baby is full when breastfeeding?
Let your baby end the feeding when he shows these signs he's full: Releases or “falls off” the breast. Turns away from the nipple. Relaxes his body and opens his fists.vishnu1$Babies are biologically programmed to fall asleep at the breast. Falling asleep at the breast is a normal behaviour and is mostly due to a hormone called cholecystokinin or CCK. CCK makes your baby feel full and sleepy and it is released in your babies gut as soon as they start sucking.vishnu1$As a rule of thumb, a truly hungry baby will rarely choose sleeping over eating. So, if your baby falls asleep in your arms without taking a full feeding, it's likely he was tired — not hungry.vishnu1$A newborn's diaper is a good indicator of whether he or she is getting enough to eat. In the first few days after birth, a baby should have 2 to 3 wet diapers each day. After the first 4 to 5 days, a baby should have at least 5 to 6 wet diapers a day. Stool frequency is more variable and depends whether your baby is breastfed or formula fed.vishnu1$During regular health check-ups, your pediatrician will check your baby's weight and plot it on a growth chart. Your baby's progress on the growth chart is one way to tell whether or not they are getting enough food. Babies who stay in healthy growth percentile ranges are probably getting a healthy amount of food during feedings.vishnu1$Babies with a condition called galactosemia should not breastfeed. Your pediatrician will let you know if this is an issue.vishnu1$Parents with HIV who live in the United States should not breastfeed due to the risk of passing this infection to their child. Your healthcare provider will let you know any other conditions that may be problematic with breastfeeding.vishnu1$What are some challenges I may face in reaching my breastfeeding goals?vishnu1$Societal pressures can get in the way of breastfeeding goals. For example, a lack of universal paid maternity leave to establish breastfeeding can be a challenge. Parents may lack adequate workplace support to pump. Ask your pediatrician about ways they can support you at your workplace. They may be able to help you identify accommodations as well as identify insurance coverage for breast pumps and supplies.vishnu1$Many parents face stigma when they choose to breastfeed, especially if they nurse in public or choose to breastfeed older children. However, breastfeeding is a human right. Pediatricians and families can work together to make sure this right is protected.vishnu1$If you choose to breastfeed beyond the first year, seek out support from your community and health care provider. Some families will choose not to breastfeed, to breastfeed for shorter durations, or combine breastfeeding with the use of infant formula. Your pediatrician can guide you on how best to safely meet your goals and the nutritional needs of your baby. No two mothers share the same goals in breastfeeding. But every parent deserves nonjudgmental support and help in feeding their infant.vishnu1$********************************Increasing Low Milk Supply**************************vishnu1$These things can cause or contribute to a low milk supply:vishnu1$Supplementing. Nursing is a supply & demand process. Milk is produced as your baby nurses, and the amount that she nurses lets your body know how much milk is required. Every bottle (of formula, juice or water) that your baby gets means that your body gets the signal to produce that much less milk.vishnu1$Bottle preference. A bottle requires a different type of sucking than nursing, and it is easier for your baby to extract milk from a bottle. As a result, giving a bottle can either cause your baby to have problems sucking properly at the breast, or can result in baby preferring the constant faster flow of the bottle.vishnu1$Pacifiers. Pacifiers can affect baby’s latch. They can also significantly reduce the amount of time your baby spends at the breast, which may cause your milk supply to drop.vishnu1$Nipple shields can be a useful tool in some cases, but they can also reduce the stimulation to your nipple or interfere with milk transfer, which can interfere with the supply-demand cycle.vishnu1$Scheduled feedings interfere with the supply & demand cycle of milk production and can lead to a reduced supply, sometimes several months later rather than immediately. Nurse your baby whenever she is hungry.vishnu1$Sleepy baby. For the first few weeks, some babies are very sleepy and only ask to nurse infrequently and for short periods. Until baby wakes up and begins to breastfeed well, nurse baby at least every two hours during the day and at least every 4 hours at night to establish your milk supply.vishnu1$Cutting short the length of nursings. Stopping a feeding before your baby ends the feeding herself can interfere with the supply-demand cycle. Also, your milk increases in fat content later into a feeding, which helps baby gain weight and last longer between feedings.vishnu1$Offering only one breast per feeding. This is fine if your milk supply is well-established and your baby is gaining weight well. If you’re trying to increase your milk supply, let baby finish the first side, then offer the second side.vishnu1$Health or anatomical problems with baby (including, jaundice, tongue-tie, etc.) can prevent baby from removing milk adequately from the breast, thus decreasing milk supply.vishnu1$Mom’s health (uncontrolled anemia or hypothyroidism, retained placenta, postpartum hemorrhage…), previous breast surgery/injury, hormonal problems (e.g. PCOS), anatomical problems, medications she is taking (hormonal birth control, sudafed…), or smoking also have the potential to affect milk supply.vishnu1$To speed milk production and increase overall milk supply, the key is to remove more milk from the breast and to do this frequently, so that less milk accumulates in the breast between feedings.vishnu1$OK, now on to things that can help increase your milk supply:vishnu1$Make sure that baby is nursing efficiently. This is the “remove more milk” part of increasing milk production. If milk is not effectively removed from the breast, then mom’s milk supply decreases. If positioning and latch are “off” then baby is probably not transferring milk efficiently. A sleepy baby, use of nipple shields or various health or anatomical problems in baby can also interfere with baby’s ability to transfer milk. For a baby who is not nursing efficiently, trying to adequately empty milk from the breast is like trying to empty a swimming pool through a drinking straw – it can take forever. Inefficient milk transfer can lead to baby not getting enough milk or needing to nurse almost constantly to get enough milk. If baby is not transferring milk well, then it is important for mom to express milk after and/or between nursings to maintain milk supply while the breastfeeding problems are being addressed.vishnu1$Nurse frequently, and for as long as your baby is actively nursing. Remember – you want to remove more milk from the breasts and do this frequently. If baby is having weight gain problems, aim to nurse at least every 1.5-2 hours during the day and at least every 3 hours at night.vishnu1$Take a nursing vacation. Take baby to bed with you for 2-3 days, and do nothing but nurse (frequently!) and rest (well, you can eat too!).vishnu1$Offer both sides at each feeding. Let baby finish the first side, then offer the second side.vishnu1$Switch nurse. Switch sides 3 or more times during each feeding, every time that baby falls asleep, switches to “comfort” sucking, or loses interest. Use each side at least twice per feeding. Use breast compression to keep baby feeding longer. For good instructions on how to do this, see Dr. Jack Newman’s Protocol to manage breastmilk intake. This can be particularly helpful for sleepy or distractible babies.vishnu1$Avoid pacifiers and bottles when possible. All of baby’s sucking needs should be met at the breast (see above). If a temporary supplement is medically required, it can be given with a nursing supplementer or by spoon, cup or dropper (see Alternative Feeding Methods).vishnu1$Give baby only breastmilk. Avoid all solids, water, and formula if baby is younger than six months, and consider decreasing solids if baby is older. If you are using more than a few ounces of formula per day, wean from the supplements gradually to “challenge” your breasts to produce more milk.vishnu1$Take care of mom. Rest. Sleep when baby sleeps. Relax. Drink liquids to thirst (don’t force liquids – drinking extra water does not increase supply), and eat a reasonably well-balanced diet.vishnu1$Consider pumping. Adding pumping sessions after or between nursing sessions can be very helpful – pumping is very important when baby is not nursing efficiently or frequently enough, and can speed things up in all situations. Your aim in pumping is to remove more milk from the breasts and/or to increase frequency of breast emptying. When pumping to increase milk supply, to ensure that the pump removes an optimum amount of milk from the breast, keep pumping for 2-5 minutes after the last drops of milk. However, adding even a short pumping session (increasing frequency but perhaps not removing milk thoroughly) is helpful.vishnu1$Consider a galactagogue. A substance (herb, prescription medication, etc.) that increases milk supply is called a galactagogue.vishnu1$Breastfed babies have a lower risk of asthma, obesity, type 1 diabetes, and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Breastfed babies are also less likely to have ear infections and stomach bugs. Breast milk shares antibodies from the mother with her baby.Breastfeeding has health benefits for both babies and mothers. Breast milk provides a baby with ideal nutrition and supports growth and development. Breastfeeding can also help protect baby and mom against certain illnesses and diseases.vishnu1$Growth hormone (GH), also known as somatotropin, is a peptide hormone that is synthesized and secreted by the somatotrophs of the anterior pituitary gland. 1 The main effect of GH is to promote linear growth in children.vishnu1$There are so many benefits to breastfeeding! Breastfeeding improves the health of nursing parents and their babies. Breastfeeding can reduce risks for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) by up to 64% and overall infant death risks by as much as 40%.vishnu1$Breastfeeding can also help protect your baby against lower respiratory tract infections and severe or persistent diarrhea, asthma, eczema, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, leukemia, tooth decay and other problems that can require orthodontia later. Studies also link breastfeeding with higher IQ scores.vishnu1$Nutrition during your baby's first 1,000 days is so important—and breastmilk is perfectly formulated for your baby's brain development and long-term health.vishnu1$There are continued benefits from breastfeeding beyond 1 year, and up to 2 years especially for the breastfeeding parent's health. This includes protection against diabetes, high blood pressure, and cancers of the breast and ovaries.

It is within six months of birth, and Your period has not returned.vishnu1$Breast milk is the food naturally designed to best meet the needs of human babies. It has all the necessary nutrients, in just the right amounts, and is easy to digest. Beyond the nutritional benefits, here's a great bonus: Breast milk also helps build and support your baby's immune system. Read on to learn how.vishnu1$Breast milk: food & infection fightervishnu1$Breast milk contains antibodies that can fight infection. Those antibodies are present in high amounts in colostrum, the first milk that comes out of the breasts after birth. However, there are antibodies in breastmilk the entire time a mother continues to nurse. Through these antibodies, the mother can pass on some protection from infectious illness she had in the past, and those she gets while breastfeeding. Breast milk can literally give babies a head start in preventing and fighting infections.vishnu1$Breast milk also is made up of other proteins, fats, sugars and even white blood cells that work to fight infection in many different ways. They are especially helpful in fighting gastrointestinal infections, since breast milk heads right to the stomach and intestine when your baby eats. The different factors in breast milk work directly within the intestine before being absorbed and reaching the entire body. This also sets the stage for a protective and balanced immune system that helps recognize and fight infections and other diseases even after breastfeeding ends.vishnu1$Other factors in breast milk directly stimulate and support the immune system. These include lactoferrin and interleukin-6, -8 and -10. These proteins help to balance the immune system inflammatory response, which is needed for immune function but can be damaging in excess.vishnu1$There's even evidence that nursing mothers who are vaccinated against COVID-19 can pass along antibodies to the virus through breast milk. Although it's not proven, these antibodies may help protect babies too young for the vaccine.vishnu1$Breast milk has "probiotic" factors, too. Some support the immune system and others serve as a nutrient source for healthy bacteria in the body, called the human microbiome. The healthy microbiome can play a lifelong role in not only preventing infection, but also in decreasing the risk of allergies, asthma, obesity and other chronic diseases.vishnu1$With all these immunity-boosting factors in breast milk, it is not surprising that breastfed babies are less likely to suffer from ear infections, vomiting, diarrhea, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and certain types of meningitis. Research also shows that children who nurse for more than six months are less likely to develop childhood leukemia and lymphoma than those who receive formula. This may be in part because these types of cancer are affected by disruptions to the immune system.vishnu1$Did you know that children’s brains grow and change more in the first 1,000 days of their lives – that is, from the time of conception to their second birthdays – than at any other time?vishnu1$The brain starts as a handful of microscopic cells. By 2 years of age, the brain has developed into a complex organ that allows children to learn to walk, talk, and read. And it’s ready for new changes and experiences, like learning math, reasoning, and complex thought.vishnu1$These brain changes are amazing, but they are also dependent on each other. That means that if the brain lacks a necessary building block during this time, it will miss out on the developmental process that building block was supposed to make. This is why the first 1,000 days are so critical – and a great time to make sure your baby is off to a healthy start.vishnu1$11 Common Conditions in Newbornsvishnu1$11 Common Conditions in Newborns
Some physical conditions are common during the first couple of weeks after birth. If you notice any of the following in your baby, contact your pediatrician.​​
Abdominal distension:vishnu1$Abdominal distension:vishnu1$Abdominal distension:vishnu1$Abdominal distension:
Most babies' bellies normally stick out, especially after a large feeding. Between feedings, however, they should feel soft. If your child's abdomen feels swollen and hard, and if she has not had a bowel movement for more than one or two days or is vomiting, call your pediatrician. Most likely the problem is due to gas or constipation, but it also could signal a more serious intestinal problem.vishnu1$Birth injuries:vishnu1$Babies can be injured during birth, especially if labor is long or difficult, or when babies are very large. While newborns recover quickly from some of these injuries, others persist. Occasionally a broken collarbone occurs, which will heal quickly. After a few weeks a small lump may form at the fracture site, but don't be alarmed; this is a sign that new bone is forming to mend the injury, and it will soon be as good as new.Muscle weakness is another common birth injury during labor, caused by pressure or stretching of the nerves attached to the muscles. These muscles, usually weakened on one side of the face or one shoulder or arm, generally re­turn to normal after several weeks. In the meantime, ask your pediatrician to show you how to nurse and hold the baby to promote healing.vishnu1$Blue baby:vishnu1$Babies may have mildly blue or purple hands and feet, which is usually normal. If their hands and feet turn slightly blue from cold, they should return to pink as soon as they are warm. Occasionally the face, tongue, and lips may turn a little blue when the newborn is crying hard, but once she is calm, her color should quickly return to normal. However, persistently blue skin coloring is a sign the heart or lungs are not operating properly. and the baby is not getting enough oxygen in the blood. Immediate medical attention is essential.vishnu1$Unusual bowel movements:vishnu1$Meconium. After birth, the staff will watch for your baby's first urination and bowel movement to make sure she has no problem with these important tasks. It may be delayed twenty-four hours or more. The first bowel movement or two will be black or dark green and very slimy. It is meconium, a substance that fills the infant's intestines before she is born. If your baby does not pass meconium in the first forty-eight hours, further evaluation is required to make sure that no problems exist in the lower bowel.Blood in stool. On occasion, newborns have a little blood in their bowel movements. If it occurs during the first few days, it usually means the infant has a little crack in the anus from stooling. This is generally harmless, but even so, let your pediatrician know about any signs of blood to confirm the reason, since there are other causes that require further evaluation and treatment.vishnu1$Coughing:vishnu1$If the baby drinks very fast, she may cough and sputter; but this type of coughing should stop as soon as her feeding routine becomes familiar. This may also be related to how strongly or fast a breastfeeding mom's milk comes down. If she coughs persistently or routinely gags during feedings, consult the pediatrician. These symptoms could indicate an underlying problem in the lungs or digestive tract.vishnu1$Excessive crying:vishnu1$All newborns cry, often for no apparent reason. If you've made sure that your baby is fed, burped, warm, and dressed in a clean diaper, the best tactic is probably to hold her and talk or sing to her until she stops. You cannot spoil a baby this age by giving her too much attention. If this doesn't work, wrap her snugly in a blanket or try some other ways that may help calm your baby.You'll become accustomed to your baby's patterns of crying. If it ever sounds peculiar—such as shrieks of pain—or if it persists for an unusual length of time, it could mean a medical problem. Call the pediatrician and ask for advice.vishnu1$Forceps marks:vishnu1$When forceps are used during delivery, they can leave red marks or even superficial scrapes on a newborn's face and head. These generally disappear within a few days. Sometimes a firm, flat lump develops in one of these areas because of minor damage to the tissue under the skin, but this, too, will usually go away within two months.vishnu1$​Jaundice:vishnu1$Many normal, healthy newborns have a yellowish tinge to their skin, which is known as jaundice. It is caused by a buildup of bilirubin in the child's blood. Mild jaundice is harmless. However, if the bilirubin level continues to rise and is not treated, it can lead to brain injury. Jaundice tends to be more common in breastfed newborns, most often in those not nursing well; breastfeeding mothers should nurse at least eight to twelve times per day, which will produce enough milk and keep bilirubin levels low.Jaundice first appears on the face, then the chest and abdomen, and finally the arms and legs in some instances. The whites of the eyes may also be yellow. Most hospitals now routinely screen newborns for jaundice twenty-four hours after birth using a painless handheld light meter. If the pediatrician suspects jaundice may be present—based on skin color as well as the baby's age and other factors—she may order a skin or blood test to definitively diagnose the condition. If jaundice develops before the baby is twenty-four hours old, a bil­irubin test is always needed to make an accurate diagnosis. If you notice a sudden increase in jaundice when your baby is at home, contact your pediatri­cian.vishnu1$Lethargy & sleepiness:vishnu1$Every newborn spends most of her time sleeping. As long as she wakes every few hours, eats well, seems content, and is alert part of the day, it's perfectly normal to sleep the rest of the time. But if she's rarely alert, does not wake up on her own for feedings, or seems too tired or uninterested to eat, you should consult your pediatrician. This lethargy—especially if it's a sudden change in her usual pattern—may be a symptom of a serious illness.vishnu1$Respiratory distress:vishnu1$It may take your baby a few hours after birth to form a normal breathing pattern, but then she should have no further difficulties. If she seems to be breathing in an unusual manner, it is most often due to blocked nasal passages. Using saline nasal drops, followed by suctioning the mucus from the nose with a bulb syringe, may fix the problem; both are available over the counter.However, if your newborn shows any of the following warning signs, no­tify your pediatrician immediately:vishnu1$Fast breathing (more than sixty breaths in one minute), although keep in mind that babies normally breathe more rapidly than adultsvishnu1$Retractions (sucking in the muscles between the ribs with each breath, so that her ribs stick out)

Umbilical cord problems:vishnu1$Umbilical cord problems:
Umbilical stump bleeding. As you're caring for your baby's umbilical cord, you may notice a few drops of blood on the diaper around the time the stump falls off. This is normal. But if the cord actively bleeds, call your baby's doctor immediately. If the stump becomes infected, it will require medical treatment. Although cord infections are uncommon, you should contact your doctor if you notice any of the following:vishnu1$Foul-smelling yellowish discharge from the cordvishnu1$Foul-smelling yellowish discharge from the cord
Red skin around the base of the cordvishnu1$Crying when you touch the cord or the skin next to itvishnu1$Umbilical granuloma. Sometimes instead of completely drying, the cord will form a granuloma or a small, reddened mass of scar tissue that stays on the belly button after the umbilical cord has fallen off. This granuloma will drain a light-yellowish fluid. This condition will usually go away in about a week, but if not, your pediatrician may need to burn off (cauterize) the granulomatous tissue.vishnu1$Umbilical hernia. If your baby's umbilical cord area seems to push outward when she cries, she may have an umbilical hernia—a small hole in the muscular part of the abdominal wall that allows the tissue to bulge out when there is increased abdominal pressure (i.e., crying). This is not a serious condition, and it usually heals by itself in the first twelve to eighteen months. (For unknown reasons it often takes longer to heal in African American babies.) In the unlikely event it doesn't heal by three to five years of age, the hole may need surgery. Don't put tape or a coin on the navel. It will not help the hernia, and it may cause a skin rash.CS328543-B     02/02/2022SAFE AND HEAL THY DIAPER CHANGINGvishnu1$STEPS IN HOME SETTINGS

Hence, it is important to understand that you may need to change the diaper every 2 to 3 hours. While it may get taxing at times, remember that not changing the diaper on time may cause rashes and irritate the skin of your baby's bums.While every baby is different, research shows that the average American baby goes through six to 10 diapers a day. The kicker? The five-diaper-a-day number is an average over three years of diapering—and the diaper habits of a 2-month-old is different from, say, a 12-month-old.Regardless of the kind of diapers you use (reusables or disposables), diapering should be every 3 hours (more or less). This means 6 or 7 diapers a day which is average for a bigger baby, newborns might need slightly more (before their digestion fully develops at approx. 2 months, newborns usually poop after every feeding).vishnu1$It is not safe to have the baby in diapers for 24 hours but recommendations say that you need to have open air time for six to eight hours every day. Whenever you are changing diapers, give 15-20 minutes of open air time to let the skin dry on its own.A good rule of thumb is to change your baby's diaper after each feeding and before and after each nap, or about every 2 hours during the day.vishnu1$Safe and healthy hygiene habits are important for all ages, but they are especially important in settings with children who are in diapers and are very young. Maintaining safe diapering and infant feeding practices is essential to reduce the spread of germs and prevent children and caregivers from getting sick.

Use a comfortable and absorbent diaper to control the moisture and prevent diaper rashes. It is highly recommended to change your baby’s diaper every 2 to 4 hours as a soiled diaper for prolonged period can increase the chances of catching infections or causing rashes. Cleaning the diaper area with an alcohol-free wipe and ensuring the area is dry is also important.

Babies are notoriously tight-lipped, but just because they won’t tell you how they’re feeling verbally, doesn’t mean they won’t show you. Here are a few ways to tell that your baby is in dire need of a diaper change.
That mischievous facevishnu1$That mischievous face
You know that surprised, scrunched-up face people make when they’re eating something really sour? That’s what babies often look like when they’re pooping. Every baby’s “wet diaper face” is different, but once you learn what your baby’s looks like, you can intervene and get them clean, dry, and comfy sooner.
An all too familiar smell
There are some smells that are loved by just about everyone, like freshly baked cookies, a long anticipated rainfall, and the first lilacs of spring. And then there are a few smells that are pretty universally feared, like dirty diapers.vishnu1$Some diapers contain perfumes, scented lotions, or other odor eaters that can actually make it hard to tell when it’s time for a change. Diapers that provide a scent light enough to temper the power of the your baby’s mess, but still allow their scent to waft, like Pampers Swaddlers, are ideal.
A helping hand
A diaper that’s wet to the touch, or that has soaked through to your baby’s clothes, is pretty obvious. Hopefully, you’ll have an awesome diaper that keeps your baby (and the outside of their diaper) dry and comfortable.vishnu1$One way to find out whether a diaper is full, without having to actually feel inside of it, is to hold your hand over the front of your baby’s diaper and jiggle it a teensy bit to see if it moves. A Pampers Swaddlers diaper has absorbing gel inside of it, and with its soft and stretchy sides a full diaper should feel like it has wiggly jelly inside of it.
Say yes to the techvishnu1$Say yes to the tech
Since no one enjoys sticking their nose right up to their baby’s diaper, the best diaper technology can make your life way easier. Pampers Swaddlers feature a game-changing, Color-Changing Wetness Indicator that lets you know when your baby might need a new diaper. With Extra Absorb Channels and Absorb Away Liners, Pampers Swaddlers keep your baby as comfortable and dry as possible between changes too.

Ideally, a skilled attendant should help at every birth and mothers and infants should have access to emergency care at
health services. While efforts are made to reach this goal, nearly 60 million births in developing countries still take place at
home without skilled care,1 contributing heavily to total maternal and infant deaths.

developing countries, only about 13 percent of mothers and infants receive postnatal care within 24 hours of a home birth.
In response to this situation, WHO and UNICEF recommend a postnatal visit to a health facility as soon as possible after a
home birth. Where this is not possible, they promote home visits to mother and infant within 24 hours, on the third day
and, if possible, before the end of the first week (seven days) after the birth.2vishnu1$and, if possible, before the end of the first week (seven days) after the birth.2

Some women who give birth in the facility will spend time there following childbirth. WHO recommends that a women not be discharged before 24 hours after birth. Regardless of the place of birth, it is important that someone accompanies the woman and newborn for the first 24 hours after birth to respond to any changes in her or her baby's condition. Many complications can occur in the first 24 hours.

  Taking Care of a Baby at Home After Birth:  
What Families Need to Do

Important  family actions during birth preparation  and the early postnatal period   
 
Ideally, a skilled attendant should help  at every birth and mothers and infants should have access to emergency care at 
health services. While efforts are made to reach this goal, nearly 60 million  births in developing countries still take place at 
home w ithout skilled care,1 contributing heavily to total maternal and infant deaths.vishnu1$home w ithout skilled care,1 contributing heavily to total maternal and infant deaths.  
 
The highest proportion of deaths of mothers and newborns occurs during delivery or within 24 hours of birth. Yet, in 
developing countries,  only about 13 percent of mothers and  infants receive postnatal care within  24 hours of a home birth. 
In response to this situation, WHO and UNICEF recommend a postnatal visit to a health facility as soon as possible after a 
home birth. Where this is not possible, they promote home visits to mother and infant within 24 hours, on the third dayvishnu1$home birth. Where this is not possible, they promote home visits to mother and infant within 24 hours, on the third day 
and, if possible, before the end of the first week (seven days) after the birth.2 
 
This material encourages use, whenever possible, of skilled birth attendants and clinical services and, where that is not  
realistic , provides some information on what families can do for pregnant women and care of the baby at birth . Even where 
mothers deliver with a skilled birth attendant in a health facility, they are often sent home within 6 –12 hours of delivery.vishnu1$mothers deliver with a skilled birth attendant in a health facility, they are often sent home within 6 –12 hours of delivery.

However, it does not have the same health benefits as breastfeeding for you and your baby. For example, it cannot protect your baby from infections. Most infant formula is made from cow’s milk, vitamins and minerals. Formula is mixed with cooled boiled water and fed to babies in a bottle or cup.You can start by offering your baby 1 to 2 ounces of infant formula every 2 to 3 hours in the first days of life if your baby is only getting infant formula and no breast milk. Give your baby more if he or she is showing signs of hunger. Most infant formula-fed newborns will feed 8 to 12 times in 24 hours.On average, your baby should take in about 2½ ounces (75 mL) of infant formula a day for every pound (453 g) of body weight. But they probably will regulate their intake from day to day to meet their own specific needs, so let them tell you when they've had enough.Formula-fed babies are more likely to have respiratory infections and food allergies than breastfed babies. Common baby formula side effects include eczema, upset stomach and runny nose. In rare cases, formula may cause necrotizing enterocolitis, or NEC, in premature babies.Traditionally, infant formulas are high in casein, making them harder to digest compared to human breast milk. Because the amino acid profiles of casein and whey proteins are different, the overall amino acid profile of human milk varies depending on the stage of lactation.Ready-to-feed formulas do not need any added water. Powdered formulas are mixed 2 ounces (60 mL) of water per each level scoop of powder. Never add extra water because dilute formula can cause a seizure. Powdered formula costs the least.When to introduce formula. If you plan to nurse and supplement with formula, it's probably best to wait until your baby is at least three to four weeks old before introducing a bottle. By then, you'll likely have a feeding pattern and solid milk supply.For infants under 3 months of age, those who were born prematurely and those who have a weakened immune system, hot water should be used to prepare formula to kill any microbes.

When your toddler is 12 months old, you can switch from infant formula to plain whole cow’s milk or fortified unsweetened soy beverage. You can do this gradually. You may want to start by replacing one infant formula feeding with cow’s milk to help your child transition.vishnu1$As your baby gradually starts eating more solid foods, the amount of infant formula he or she needs each day will likely start to decrease.
Some feeding sessions may be long, and other feedings short. That is okay. Babies will generally take what they need at each feeding and stop eating when they are full.
The nutrients in formula support a baby’s growth during their first 6 months. Once they reach 6 months, they can start eating solids as well, but a baby should not drink regular cow’s milk until they are at least 12 months old.vishnu1$The main sources of protein in formula come from cow’s milk.

Weaning is the process of switching an infant's diet from breast milk or formula to other foods and fluids. In most cases, choosing when to wean is a personal decision. It might be influenced by a return to work, the mother's or infant's health, or just a feeling that the time is right.vishnu1$Weaning an infant is a gradual process. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends feeding infants only breast milk for the first 6 months after birth. After 6 months, the AAP recommends a combination of solid foods and breast milk until the infant is at least 1 year old. The Academy advises against giving cow's milk to children younger than 1 year old.You may have difficulty determining how much to feed your child and when to start introducing solid foods. The general guidance below, as reported by the National Library of Medicine, demonstrates the process of weaning for infants up to 6 months of age. You should speak with your infant's health care provider before attempting to wean your infant to make sure that he or she is ready for weaning and for complete guidance on weaning.vishnu1$Birth to 4 months of age
During the first 4 to 6 months, infants need only breast milk or formula to meet their nutritional needs.
If breastfeeding, a newborn may need to nurse eight to 12 times per day. By 4 months of age, an infant may need to nurse only four to six times per day.
By comparison, formula-fed infants may need to be fed about six to eight times per day, with newborns consuming about 2 to 3 ounces per feeding. The number of feedings will decrease as the infant gets older, similar to breastfeeding.
4 to 6 months of agevishnu1$4 to 6 months of age
At 4 to 6 months of age, an infant needs to consume 28 to 45 ounces of breast milk or formula per day and often is ready to start being introduced to solid food.
Starting solid foods too soon can be hazardous, so an infant should not be fed solid food until he or she is physically ready.

Most health experts recommend that babies begin getting solid food at around 4-6 months of age (2Trusted Source, 3, 4, 5).
Six months is often recommended because babies, at this age, begin to need extra nutrients not found in milk, such as iron and zinc (6Trusted Source, 7Trusted Source).
Small amounts of solid food can provide these nutrients.
Experts also suggest looking for signs that a baby is developmentally ready for solids. These include (8Trusted Source, 9):

Baby-led weaning encourages infants to feed themselves, whereas you feed your child a progressively more solid diet under the traditional method. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages.vishnu1$First tastes are important for developing good eating habits and exposing your infant to a wide variety of flavors.When introducing new foods, remember that the amount eaten is less important than the number of foods tried. In the beginning stages of weaning, your baby will still get most of its nutrition from breastmilk or formula.Try to make this a positive experience for your baby by allowing them to play with, touch and taste new foods.Around an hour after a milk feed and when your baby isn’t too tired is often a good time to try food. Mixing foods with a little breastmilk or formula milk can improve acceptance.vishnu1$Appropriate first foods include:
Soft, cooked vegetables: Broccoli, carrot, potato, sweet potato, butternut squash, pumpkin, peas — pureed, mashed or served as finger food
Soft fruit: Banana, mango, blueberries, raspberries, avocado, cooked pear or apple, plums, peaches — pureed, mashed or served as finger food

Through these antibodies, the mother can pass on some protection from infectious illness she had in the past, and those she gets while breastfeeding. Breast milk can literally give babies a head start in preventing and fighting infections.vishnu1$Breast milk also is made up of other proteins, fats, sugars and even white blood cells that work to fight infection in many different ways. They are especially helpful in fighting gastrointestinal infections, since breast milk heads right to the stomach and intestine when your baby eats. The different factors in breast milk work directly within the intestine before being absorbed and reaching the entire body. This also sets the stage for a protective and balanced immune system that helps recognize and fight infections and other diseases even after breastfeeding ends.vishnu1$Other factors in breast milk directly stimulate and support the immune system. These include lactoferrin and interleukin-6, -8 and -10. These proteins help to balance the immune system inflammatory response, which is needed for immune function but can be damaging in excess.
There's even evidence that nursing mothers who are vaccinated against COVID-19 can pass along antibodies to the virus through breast milk. Although it's not proven, these antibodies may help protect babies too young for the vaccine.vishnu1$Breast milk has "probiotic" factors, too. Some support the immune system and others serve as a nutrient source for healthy bacteria in the body, called the human microbiome. The healthy microbiome can play a lifelong role in not only preventing infection, but also in decreasing the risk of allergies, asthma, obesity and other chronic diseases.vishnu1$With all these immunity-boosting factors in breast milk, it is not surprising that breastfed babies are less likely to suffer from ear infections, vomiting, diarrhea, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and certain types of meningitis. Research also shows that children who nurse for more than six months are less likely to develop childhood leukemia and lymphoma than those who receive formula. This may be in part because these types of cancer are affected by disruptions to the immune system.vishnu1$Did you know that children’s brains grow and change more in the first 1,000 days of their lives – that is, from the time of conception to their second birthdays – than at any other time?
The brain starts as a handful of microscopic cells. By 2 years of age, the brain has developed into a complex organ that allows children to learn to walk, talk, and read. And it’s ready for new changes and experiences, like learning math, reasoning, and complex thought.vishnu1$These brain changes are amazing, but they are also dependent on each other. That means that if the brain lacks a necessary building block during this time, it will miss out on the developmental process that building block was supposed to make. This is why the first 1,000 days are so critical – and a great time to make sure your baby is off to a healthy start.
Breastfeeding is a natural way for mothers to supply their infants with all the nutrition and food they need for the first months of life. It may also help mothers recover more quickly from childbirth.vishnu1$In the United States, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) currently recommends: Infants should be fed breast milk exclusively for the first 6 months after birth.Exclusive breastfeeding means that the infant does not receive any additional foods (except vitamin D) or fluids unless medically recommended.After the first 6 months and until the infant is 1 year old, the AAP recommends that the mother continue breastfeeding while gradually introducing solid foods into the infant's diet.vishnu1$After 1 year, breastfeeding can be continued if mutually desired by the mother and her infant.The World Health Organization currently promotes as a global public health recommendation that: Infants be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months after birth to achieve optimal growth, development, and health.
After the first 6 months, to meet their evolving nutritional requirements, infants should receive nutritionally adequate and safe complementary foods while breastfeeding continues for up to 2 years of age or beyond.vishnu1$Breastfeeding has both short- and long-term health benefits for mother and infant. For the baby, these benefits include:Reduced infections. There’s a correlation between babies who are breastfed and having fewer childhood infections, such as ear, respiratoryTrusted Source, and gutTrusted Source infections as well as fewer colds.
Better immunity against viruses and bacteria. Breast milk contains immunoglobulinsTrusted Source, or antibodies, from the mother. These proteins help strengthen the infant’s immune system so it can defend itself.vishnu1$Reduced risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Breastfed babies have a lower risk for SIDS, both in the first month and first year of the baby’s life.
A healthier weight. Children who are breastfed may have a lower rateTrusted Source of childhood obesity compared to formula-fed babies.
Lower risk of diabetes. Breastfeeding reduces a child’s risk for both type 1Trusted Source and type 2Trusted Source diabetes.vishnu1$Lower risk of diabetes. Breastfeeding reduces a child’s risk for both type 1Trusted Source and type 2Trusted Source diabetes.

The benefits of breastfeeding aren’t for baby alone. Breastfeeding mothers may experience some benefits from breastfeeding as well. These benefits include:Improved recovery. Breastfeeding releases higher levels of oxytocin. This hormone can help improve uterine contractionsTrusted Source. That will also help the uterusTrusted Source return to its prepregnancy size.vishnu1$Losing pregnancy weight faster. Those who breastfeed exclusively may lose more weight postpartumTrusted Source than those who don’t breastfeed.
Reduced risk of depression. Mothers may also reduceTrusted Source their risk for postpartum depression by breastfeeding their infants.
Lower risk of some cancers. The longer a mother spends breastfeeding, the lowerTrusted Source their risk for breast and ovarian cancers.vishnu1$Lower rates of some medical conditions. Research shows those who breastfeed for one to two years during their lifetime also have a 10 to 50 percent lower risk of certain conditions, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol and triglycerides, arthritis, and high blood pressure. Formula is a nutritious alternative to breast milk for those who choose to use it or need to because of medical reasons.Baby formula sold in the United States is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. While formula doesn’t match natural breast milk completely.A baby’s body doesn’t process formula as quickly as it does breast milk. That may allow you or another caregiver more time between feedings.However, formula can be costly. Depending on the type and quantity your baby uses, a month’s supply could cost more than $100.Before your baby is born, your body will begin producing breast milk. It’s preparing you for the infant’s arrival and the nourishment you’ll need to give them right away.Your first feeding may be within a few hours of childbirth. That first breast milk is called colostrum. It’s a thick, yellow, sticky substance that’s rich with nutrients. It helps prime your baby’s gastrointestinal system for future feedings.A few short days after giving birth, your body will begin producing a different type of breast milk. This milk is also very rich in nutrients and will fully sustain your infant for their first months.Breastfeeding is a bonding exercise. You’ll learn your baby’s hunger cues and they’ll learn to respond to your body.vishnu1$How to get a good latch: Start by resting your baby in a comfortable breastfeeding position that’s facing you. If baby has to twist their neck at all, they may not breastfeed well.Uncover a breast from your bra or shirt. Gently stroke your baby’s lower lip with your nipple. Their mouth will naturally open wide, and their tongue will cup and lower into their mouth.Place your baby’s mouth directly onto your nipple. They’ll instinctually close and begin to draw.You’ll know your baby’s mouth is positioned correctly if you see their lips pursed outward and their mouth covers all of your nipple and most of your darker areola.If you experience any discomfort or pain, gently break the baby’s suction. Slide your pinkie between the corner of your baby’s mouth and your nipple. Push down. The latch will pop. Pull baby away.Before bringing baby back to your nipple, try to get them to open their mouth as wide as possible. Repeat the steps until the latch is comfortable and your baby is breastfeeding in a smooth, even rhythm.Establishing a good latch will help baby get adequate milk. It’ll prevent pain and discomfort for you too.If you continue to struggle with producing a strong latch, talk to your pediatrician or a lactation consultant. They are there to help you.How to manage sore nipples: Many moms experience pain and soreness in the first few days of breastfeeding. This is very common.What causes sore nipples while breastfeeding?vishnu1$Sore nipples are very common for breastfeeding women. Prevention is possible and treatment depends on what the cause is. The most common causes include:
a baby not latching well
chafing
thrush
adapting to this new skill
You might even have more than one cause of sore nipples.Is baby getting enough milk?
With breastfeeding, it’s hard to know precisely how much milk your baby is getting with each feeding. Instead of trying to measure ounces, look for signs in other places:Your baby makes plenty of dirty diapers. Babies who are getting enough milk have 6 to 8 wet diapers per day.vishnu1$Your baby is gaining weight. After an initial weight drop in the first few days after delivery, your baby should begin steadily gaining weight. If the weight continues to fall, you may not be producing enough milk. Talk with your baby’s pediatrician or a lactation consultant if baby isn’t gaining weight.
Your baby shows no signs of hunger. Babies who are fed are content. If your baby shows hunger cues more frequently, they may not be getting enough milk in each session.vishnu1$1-3 days age children wets 1-2 diapers and 1-2 pop diapers.4 days age children wets 4-6 diapers and 4 pop diapers.5-28 days age children wets 6+ diapers and 3+ pop diapers.A lactation consultant will likely come visit you in the hospital in your baby’s first 24 hours. These healthcare providers are trained to help mothers learn to breastfeed.They’ll watch you while breastfeeding, offering instruction and correction.They may help you understand what a good latch feels like. They can answer any questions you have too.Your insurance may cover a lactation consultant.vishnu1$Remember, breastfeeding is a learned skill.It takes time and practice.Breastfeeding may help reduceTrusted Source your risk of developing certain medical conditions later in life, including heart disease and diabetes. It may also relieve stress and help you feel more connected to your new baby. All good things.Plus, breast milk is chock-full of nourishing nutrients and protective compounds that are essential for your babys development. This is why 'breast milk is known as the “gold standard” for infant nutrition and is often referred to as liquid gold.With the exception of vitamin D, breast milk contains everything your baby needs for proper development during the first 6 months.vishnu1$"Research shows that breast milk is made up of 87 percent water, 3.8 percent fat, 1.0 percent protein, and 7 percent carbohydrate and provides 60 to 75 kcal/100ml".vishnu1$Breast milk changes during each feeding and throughout your lactation period, in order to meet the needs of your baby.At the beginning of a feeding, the milk is more watery and usually quenches the baby’s thirst. The milk that comes later (hindmilk) is thicker, higher in fat and more nutritious.In fact according to an older 2005 studyTrusted Source, this milk may contain 2 to 3 times as much fat as milk from the beginning of a feeding, and 7 to 11 more calories per ounce. Therefore, to get to the most nutritious milk, it’s important that your baby empties one breast before switching to the other.In fact, it’s estimated that your energy needs during breastfeeding increase by about 500 caloriesTrusted Source per day. The need for specific nutrients, including protein, vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, B12, selenium, and zinc go up as well.vishnu1$Here are some nutritious and delicious food choices to prioritize when breastfeeding:
Fish and seafood: salmon, seaweed, shellfish, sardines
Meat and poultry: chicken, beef, lamb, pork, organ meats (such as liver)
Fruits and vegetables: berries, tomatoes, bell peppers, cabbage, kale, garlic, broccoli
Nuts and seeds: almonds, walnuts, chia seeds, hemp seeds, flaxseeds
Healthy fats: avocados, olive oil, coconut, eggs, full-fat yogurt
Fiber-rich starches: potatoes, butternut squash, sweet potatoes, beans, lentils, oats, quinoa, buckwheat
Other foods: tofu, dark chocolate, kimchi, sauerkraut.vishnu1$Fiber-rich starches: potatoes, butternut squash, sweet potatoes, beans, lentils, oats, quinoa, buckwheat

However, it can build up in your infant’s body over time.Consuming up to 300 mg of caffeine per day while breastfeeding appears to be safe for mothers and infants. Excess intake may lead to infant sleeping issues and restlessness, anxiety, dizziness, and rapid heartbeat in moms.The amount of caffeine in common beverages varies widely. Coffee, tea, sodas, hot chocolate, and energy drinks all contain caffeine.Caffeine content is affected by the type of coffee bean, roast style, how the coffee is prepared and the serving size.The average caffeine content of an 8-oz, brewed cup of coffee is 95 mg. A single espresso or espresso-based drink contains 63 mg, and decaf coffee contains about 3 mg of caffeine (on average).Coffee is high in antioxidants, and many studies show that it is good for your health.However, getting too much caffeine is linked to adverse effects like anxiety, sleep disruptions, heart palpitations and restlessness (14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).Consuming 400–600 mg/day of caffeine is generally not associated with adverse effects in most people. This is about 6 mg/kg (3 mg/lb) of body weight, or 4–6 average cups of coffee per day (16Trusted Source).vishnu1$The things you eat and drink can be transferred to your baby through your milk. Women who are breast-feeding are advised to avoid alcohol, caffeine, and certain medications.Caffeine can stay in your system for five to 20 hours. If you are taking medications, have higher body fat, or other medical problems, it may stick around longer.Caffeine can stay in a newborn’s system much longer than an adult’s system, so you could be dealing with fussiness and sleep problems for quite some time.vishnu1$Green tea certainly doesn’t have as much caffeine as coffee, and you can even get caffeine-free varieties. An 8-ounce serving of regular green tea has about 24 to 45 mg, compared with 95 to 200 mg in brewed coffee.In general, you can drink one to three cups of green tea a day and not have any harmful effects on your newborn.“It’s recommended not to consume more than 300 mg of caffeine a day if you’re breast-feeding.”According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), breast milk contains less than 1 percent of the caffeine taken in by the mom. If you’re not drinking more than three cups, you should be OK.Some other low- to caffeine-free teas that are safe to drink while breast-feeding are:vishnu1$white tea
chamomile tea
ginger tea
peppermint tea
dandelion
rose hips
“If you feel as though you have consumed something unsafe for your baby, it’s best to ‘pump and dump’ for 24 hours. After 24 hours, you can safely resume breast-feeding,”.Pump and dump refers to pumping your milk supply and getting rid of it without feeding your baby. This way, you work through the milk that might have too much caffeine.

To feed previously frozen milk to your baby, simply thaw the milk and serve cool or warm to body temperature.You can thaw frozen breast milk by placing it in the refrigerator overnight or for approximately 12 hours. From there, you can store thawed breast milk in your refrigerator for up to 24 hours. After that, the milk might be more apt to grow bacteria.To warm milk that’s been thawed in the refrigerator, place it under warm running water until it reaches body temperature. Be sure to test the milk before offering it to your baby to ensure it won’t burn their mouth. You can also swirl the milk to mix in the cream of the milk that rises during freezing.Any milk used to feed your baby throughout the day should be discarded after the feeding or within one or two hours.Once milk has been thawed using this method, it should be used within two hours.vishnu1$Refer "https://www.healthline.com/health/parenting/how-to-thaw-breast-milk" for how to Safely Store, Use, and Thaw Frozen Breast Milk.

The meaning of wean is to start feeding (a child or young animal) food other than its mother's milk.How to wean baby off of breastfeedingvishnu1$Leading healthcare organizations, like the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), AAP, and WHO, recommend exclusively breastfeeding for the first six months of a baby’s life.After that point, you can begin introducing solid foods. That will begin to reduce how much breastfeeding you do.ACOG and AAP say supplemental breastfeeding is good for the first full year. WHO suggests you can practice extended breastfeeding and breastfeed your baby up to age 2.But when to stop breastfeeding is a personal decision. Do what works best for you and your family.Weaning your baby is a process, but it can be accomplished. You can follow your baby’s lead and wean naturally as they begin eating other foods and drinking cow’s milk, juice, or other beverages.Or you can take charge and decide when the weaning process will begin. This may be met with some resistance, but timing and persistence can help you overcome any obstacle.Start slowly. Gradually reduce the amount of breastfeeding. This helps your baby adjust to scaled-back feedings. Your breasts will naturally stop producing as much milk too.A daytime feeding may be easiest to skip at first. You can keep your child busy during that normal feeding period by finding an activity to do or being away from the house.Avoid normal breastfeeding spots during this period. The familiar scenes may conjure up cravings for your baby. By steering you and baby away from those chairs, beds, or other spots, you can help change the habit.Most newborns eat every 2 to 3 hours, or 8 to 12 times every 24 hours. Babies might only take in half ounce per feeding for the first day or two of life, but after that will usually drink 1 to 2 ounces at each feeding. This amount increases to 2 to 3 ounces by 2 weeks of age.some signs that baby is hungry are : Licking lips,Sticking tongue out,Rooting (moving jaw and mouth or head in search of breast),Putting his/her hand to mouth repeatedly,Opening her mouth,Fussiness,Sucking on everything around.vishnu1$​In the first week after birth, babies should be eating no more than about 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 ml) per feed.During the first month, babies gradually eat more until they take 3 to 4 ounces (90 to 120 ml) per feed, amounting to 32 ounces per day. Formula-fed babies typically feed on a more regular schedule, such as every 3 or 4 hours. Breastfed babies usually take smaller, more frequent feedings than formula-fed infants.If your baby sleeps longer than 4 to 5 hours during the first few weeks after birth and starts missing feedings, wake them up and offer a bottle.vishnu1$By the end of the first month: Your baby will be up to at least 3 to 4 ounces (120 mL) per feeding, with a fairly predictable schedule of feedings about every 3 to 4 hours.By 6 months: Your baby will consume 6 to 8 ounces (180–240 mL) at each of 4 or 5 feedings in 24 hours.
It is important to remember all babies are different―some like to snack more often, and others drink more at one time and go longer between feedings. However, most babies will drink more and go longer between feedings as they get bigger and their tummies can hold more milk:vishnu1$Most newborns eat every 2 to 3 hours, or 8 to 12 times every 24 hours. Babies might only take in half ounce per feeding for the first day or two of life, but after that will usually drink 1 to 2 ounces at each feeding. This amount increases to 2 to 3 ounces by 2 weeks of age.
At about 2 months of age, babies usually take 4 to 5 ounces per feeding every 3 to 4 hours.
At 4 months, babies usually take 4 to 6 ounces per feeding.
At 6 months, babies may be taking up to 8 ounces every 4 to 5 hours.vishnu1$At 6 months, babies may be taking up to 8 ounces every 4 to 5 hours.
Most babies will increase the amount of formula they drink by an average of 1 ounce each month before leveling off at about 7 to 8 ounces per feeding. Solid foods should be started at about 6 months old.Most babies will double their birth weight by 5 months of age and triple their birth weight by their first birthday. If your baby is having trouble gaining weight, don't wait too long between feeding―even if it means waking your baby. Be sure to talk with your pediatrician about how often and how much to feed your baby.vishnu1$Concerns about overfeeding or underfeeding your baby:vishnu1$Babies are usually pretty good at eating the right amount, but they can sometimes take in more than they need. Infants who are bottle feeding may be more likely to overfeed, because drinking from a bottle may take less effort than breastfeeding. Overfed babies can have stomach pains, gas, spit up or vomit and be at higher risk for obesity later in life. It's better to offer less, since you can always give more if your baby wants it. This also gives babies time to realize when they're full.If you are concerned your baby wants to eat all the time―even when he or she is full―talk with your pediatrician. Pacifiers may be used after feeding to help sooth healthy-weight babies who like to suck for comfort, rather than nutrition. For babies who are breastfed, it's best to wait to offer pacifiers until around 3 to 4 weeks of age, when breastfeeding is well-established.vishnu1$Formula feeding based on body weight:vishnu1$On average, your baby should take in about 2½ ounces (75 mL) of infant formula a day for every pound (453 g) of body weight. But they probably will regulate their intake from day to day to meet their own specific needs, so let them tell you when they've had enough. If they become fidgety or easily distracted during a feeding, they're probably finished. If they drain the bottle and continues smacking their lips, they might still be hungry.There are high and low limits, however. If your baby consistently seems to want more or less than this, discuss it with your pediatrician. Your baby should usually drink no more than an average of about 32 ounces (960 mL) of formula in 24 hours. Some babies have higher needs for sucking and may just want to suck on a pacifier after feeding.vishnu1$On-demand feeding
Initially it is best to feed your formula-fed newborn a bottle on demand, or whenever they cry with hunger. As time passes, your baby will begin to develop a fairly regular timetable of their own. As you become familiar with their signals and needs, you'll be able to schedule their feedings around their routine.
Eating & sleeping patterns:vishnu1$Between 2 and 4 months of age (or when the baby weighs more than 12 lb. [5.4 kg]), most formula-fed babies no longer need a middle-of-the-night feedings. They're consuming more during the day, and their sleeping patterns have become more regular (although this varies considerably from baby to baby). Their stomach capacity has increased, too, which means they may go longer between daytime feedings—occasionally up to 4 or 5 hours at a time.If your baby still seems to feed very frequently or consume larger amounts, try distracting them with play or with a pacifier. Sometimes patterns of obesity begin during infancy, so it is important not to overfeed your baby.vishnu1$Getting to know your baby's feeding needs:
The most important thing to remember, whether you breastfeed or bottlefeed, is that your baby's feeding needs are unique. No book―or website―can tell you precisely how much or how often they need to be fed or exactly how you should handle them during feedings. You will discover these things for yourself as you and your baby get to know each other.
On day one of life, your baby’s stomach is the size of a marble and can only hold 1 to 1.4 teaspoons of liquid at a time. As your baby gets older, their stomach stretches and grows.vishnu1$On day one of life, your baby’s stomach is the size of a marble and can only hold 1 to 1.4 teaspoons of liquid at a time.

feeding guidelines for 4-6 months:Feeding Amount: Babies between 4 and 6 months of age generally consume 4-8 ounces of breast milk or formula per feeding.vishnu1$Solid Foods: At this stage, solid foods may be introduced if the baby can hold their head up and weighs at least 13 pounds. However, it's important to note that solid foods are not a replacement for breast milk or formula but rather a supplemental addition. You can start with soft foods like one-grain cereals and pureed vegetables, meats, and fruits. It is recommended to introduce one new food at a time and observe for any allergies or adverse reactions.vishnu1$feeding guidelines for 6-12 months:Feeding Amount: Babies between 6 and 12 months of age generally consume around 8 ounces of breast milk or formula per feeding.
Solid Foods: By this stage, solid foods become an important part of the baby's diet alongside breast milk or formula. You can progress from pureed foods to mashed and well-chopped finger foods. It's essential to introduce a variety of foods to expose the baby to different flavors and textures. However, continue to breastfeed or provide formula as the primary source of nutrition.vishnu1$Breast milk has antibacterial and antiviral elements.Depending on how long you breastfeed for, you’ll be lowering your baby’s risk of contracting colds and flu, ear and respiratory tract infections, sickness and diarrhoea. Scientists are even investigating breast milk’s potential for treating conditions ranging from conjunctivitis to cancer.vishnu1$Yes. Breastfeeding a sick baby gives her a great chance of a speedy recovery, as well as helping to comfort her. Your breast milk contains antibodies, white blood cells, stem cells and protective enzymes that fight infections and may help with healing.It also has a constantly adjusting balance of vitamins and nutrients, supporting her to get better as quickly as possible. And that means fewer sick days and visits to the doctor for both of you.vishnu1$“Breastfeeding provides everything your baby needs if she’s poorly – it’s her medicine as well as her food, fluid and comfort. It’s the best thing on the planet for her,” says Sarah Beeson, a UK-based health visitor and nurse.
Amazingly, the composition of your breast milk changes when your baby is ill. If you’re exposed to a bacterial or viral infection, your body makes antibodies to combat it; these are then transferred to your baby through your milk. The levels of immunity-boosting cells, called leukocytes, in your milk also rise rapidly whenever your baby is unwell.vishnu1$And because breast milk is very easy to digest, it’s also the ideal food for babies with upset tummies.
What if my baby seems too unwell to breastfeed?vishnu1$Sometimes when a baby is feeling really ill she may not have the appetite or energy to breastfeed. If you’re struggling to get her to feed, contact a healthcare professional, lactation consultant or breastfeeding specialist for advice to prevent her becoming dehydrated.They may advise you to express some milk to feed to your baby from a syringe, cup, or other method that you’ve found requires the least effort from her to drink from. Expressing when you would normally breastfeed will also keep your milk supply steady. If you have any concerns about your baby’s health or milk intake, always seek medical advice quickly.vishnu1$Can I still breastfeed when sick?vishnu1$It may be the last thing you feel like doing, but it’s best to keep breastfeeding through almost any common illness. If you have a cold or flu, fever, diarrhoea and vomiting, or mastitis, keep breastfeeding as normal. Your baby won’t catch the illness through your breast milk – in fact, it will contain antibodies to reduce her risk of getting the same bug.Not only is it safe, breastfeeding while sick is a good idea. Your baby is actually the person least likely to fall ill with your tummy upset or cold, as she has already been in close contact with you and is getting a daily dose of those protective antibodies from your milk.However, being sick and continuing to breastfeed can be extremely tiring. You’ll need to look after yourself so you can look after your baby. Keep your fluid levels up, eat when you can, and remember your body needs extra rest. Book a seat on your sofa and snuggle up with your baby for a few days, and ask family or friends to help with caring for your baby when possible so you can focus on recovering.Don’t worry about your breast milk supply – you will keep producing it. Just don’t stop breastfeeding abruptly as you’ll run the risk of getting mastitis.Good hygiene is important to minimise the risk of spreading the illness. Wash your hands with soap before and after feeding your baby, preparing and eating food, going to the toilet or changing nappies. Catch coughs and sneezes in a tissue, or in the crook of your elbow (not your hands) if you don’t have one with you, and always wash or sanitise your hands after coughing, sneezing or blowing your nose.vishnu1$Yes, it is still safe to breastfeed when you're feeling under the weather. Breast milk is still the healthiest source of nourishment for your baby while also providing your baby with antibodies and other immunological factors that will help keep your little one from getting sick. If you're too sick to breastfeed, expressed breast milk has the same benefits — just choose a healthy caregiver to feed your baby a bottle.vishnu1$Even if you're sick with COVID-19, you can still feed your baby breast milk, the latest recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Opens a new windowstate. If you're nursing, wash your hands well beforehand and wear a mask during feedings and any time you're within 6 feet of your baby. Increasing ventilation — by opening windows or turning on an air purifier — can also help prevent the virus from spreading. If you're pumping, wash those hands thoroughly before you start, and sanitize pump parts afterwards. If there's a healthy, vaccinated caregiver around, have that person handle feedings (with a mask on just in case).vishnu1$Does illness pass through breast milk: Cold and flu viruses do not pass through breast milk. Current evidence also suggests that the coronavirus also does not spread through breast milk, although moms with COVID-19 could transmit the virus to their babies through tiny airborne droplets when they cough, sneeze or talk.Certain more serious diseases such as HIV, HTLV-1 or brucellosis (a rare bacterial infection) do pass through breast milk, and you should talk to your doctor if you have been diagnosed with one of these illnesses.

Some medications, however, are clearly harmful. These include (but are not limited to): Cancer drugs , Certain epilepsy and seizure drugs, Ergots (used to treat migraines), Some beta blockers (used to treat irregular heartbeat and high blood pressure), And some medications should be avoided because they can reduce your milk supply, including (but not limited to): Pseudoephedrine, an antihistamine (Sudafed).vishnu1$The jury is still out on other medications — certain classes of antihistamines, for instance, or some antidepressants (although most are safe and treating postpartum depression may improve milk supply). And other medications are safe, but only if they're used sparingly and temporarily, such as narcotics for pain after a cesarean delivery, for instance. (Take only one tablet every six to eight hours maximum and watch for drowsiness in the baby.) Be sure to check with your baby's pediatrician for the most up-to-date info on what is and isn't safe.vishnu1$In some cases, a less-safe medication can safely be discontinued while a mom is breastfeeding, and in others, it's possible to find a safer substitute. When medication that isn't compatible with breastfeeding is needed short-term, nursing can be stopped temporarily (with breasts pumped and milk tossed — i.e. "pump and dump").
You can also time the dosing for just after nursing or before your baby's longest sleep period (after you put her to bed for the night). As always, only take medicines — and that includes herbals and supplements — with your practitioner's approval.vishnu1$And if you do start a new doctor-approved medication, keep an eye on your baby for any unusual changes such as fussiness, rash or a change in eating or sleeping habits.

Talk to your doctor before taking any cold medicine to see what he or she recommends.
Breastfeed while you are sick: "Take good care of yourself and your breastfeeding baby, and feel better soon!"vishnu1$Full milk production is typically 25-35 oz. (750-1,035 mL) per 24 hours. Once you have reached full milk production, maintain a schedule that continues producing about 25-35oz of breastmilk in a 24 hour period. For the first 2 to 5 days after your baby is born, you will make a small amount of colostrum, which is all a healthy term baby needs. Colostrum is a thick, rich milk that is high in nutrients. Around day 3 through 5, your milk will come in. In an average fifteen to twenty minute breast milk pumping session, most moms express between . 5 ounces and four ounces of breast milk total. Each mom and baby are different, plan your pumping sessions around what works best for the two of you.Your milk supply depends on how often you nurse or pump your breasts. The more you breastfeed or pump, the more milk your body makes. So, if you seem to be producing less milk than usual, nurse your baby more often. You also can pump after nursing to help stimulate more milk production.vishnu1$Signs That a Breastfed Baby Is Being Well Nourished
Your baby nurses at least 8 to 16 times in 24 hours, or every 2 to 3 hours. Your baby may be fussy once or twice a day. At these times, he or she wants to nurse often for several hours before seeming full. This is called cluster feeding.
Your baby wets at least 6 cloth or 5 disposable diapers and has at least 1 bowel movement in 24 hours. This occurs by 1 week of age.

It is important to realize, however, that every time your baby cries or sucks it is not necessarily because he or she is hungry. Babies suck not only for hunger, but also for comfort; it can be hard at first for parents to tell the difference. Sometimes, your baby just needs to be cuddled or changed.vishnu1$Newborns may nurse for up to 20 minutes or longer on one or both breasts. As babies get older and more skilled at breastfeeding, they may take about 5–10 minutes on each side.
How do I know my baby is full when breastfeeding?
Let your baby end the feeding when he shows these signs he's full: Releases or “falls off” the breast. Turns away from the nipple. Relaxes his body and opens his fists.vishnu1$Let your baby end the feeding when he shows these signs he's full: Releases or “falls off” the breast. Turns away from the nipple. Relaxes his body and opens his fists.
Babies are biologically programmed to fall asleep at the breast. Falling asleep at the breast is a normal behaviour and is mostly due to a hormone called cholecystokinin or CCK. CCK makes your baby feel full and sleepy and it is released in your babies gut as soon as they start sucking.vishnu1$As a rule of thumb, a truly hungry baby will rarely choose sleeping over eating. So, if your baby falls asleep in your arms without taking a full feeding, it's likely he was tired — not hungry.
A newborn's diaper is a good indicator of whether he or she is getting enough to eat. In the first few days after birth, a baby should have 2 to 3 wet diapers each day. After the first 4 to 5 days, a baby should have at least 5 to 6 wet diapers a day. Stool frequency is more variable and depends whether your baby is breastfed or formula fed.vishnu1$During regular health check-ups, your pediatrician will check your baby's weight and plot it on a growth chart. Your baby's progress on the growth chart is one way to tell whether or not they are getting enough food.

What are some challenges I may face in reaching my breastfeeding goals?vishnu1$What are some challenges I may face in reaching my breastfeeding goals?
Societal pressures can get in the way of breastfeeding goals. For example, a lack of universal paid maternity leave to establish breastfeeding can be a challenge. Parents may lack adequate workplace support to pump. Ask your pediatrician about ways they can support you at your workplace. They may be able to help you identify accommodations as well as identify insurance coverage for breast pumps and supplies.vishnu1$Many parents face stigma when they choose to breastfeed, especially if they nurse in public or choose to breastfeed older children. However, breastfeeding is a human right. Pediatricians and families can work together to make sure this right is protected.vishnu1$If you choose to breastfeed beyond the first year, seek out support from your community and health care provider. Some families will choose not to breastfeed, to breastfeed for shorter durations, or combine breastfeeding with the use of infant formula. Your pediatrician can guide you on how best to safely meet your goals and the nutritional needs of your baby. No two mothers share the same goals in breastfeeding. But every parent deserves nonjudgmental support and help in feeding their infant.
********************************Increasing Low Milk Supply**************************vishnu1$********************************Increasing Low Milk Supply**************************
These things can cause or contribute to a low milk supply:
Supplementing. Nursing is a supply & demand process. Milk is produced as your baby nurses, and the amount that she nurses lets your body know how much milk is required. Every bottle (of formula, juice or water) that your baby gets means that your body gets the signal to produce that much less milk.vishnu1$Bottle preference. A bottle requires a different type of sucking than nursing, and it is easier for your baby to extract milk from a bottle. As a result, giving a bottle can either cause your baby to have problems sucking properly at the breast, or can result in baby preferring the constant faster flow of the bottle.
Pacifiers. Pacifiers can affect baby’s latch. They can also significantly reduce the amount of time your baby spends at the breast, which may cause your milk supply to drop.vishnu1$Pacifiers. Pacifiers can affect baby’s latch. They can also significantly reduce the amount of time your baby spends at the breast, which may cause your milk supply to drop.
Nipple shields can be a useful tool in some cases, but they can also reduce the stimulation to your nipple or interfere with milk transfer, which can interfere with the supply-demand cycle.
Scheduled feedings interfere with the supply & demand cycle of milk production and can lead to a reduced supply, sometimes several months later rather than immediately. Nurse your baby whenever she is hungry.vishnu1$Sleepy baby. For the first few weeks, some babies are very sleepy and only ask to nurse infrequently and for short periods. Until baby wakes up and begins to breastfeed well, nurse baby at least every two hours during the day and at least every 4 hours at night to establish your milk supply.
Cutting short the length of nursings. Stopping a feeding before your baby ends the feeding herself can interfere with the supply-demand cycle. Also, your milk increases in fat content later into a feeding, which helps baby gain weight and last longer between feedings.vishnu1$Offering only one breast per feeding. This is fine if your milk supply is well-established and your baby is gaining weight well. If you’re trying to increase your milk supply, let baby finish the first side, then offer the second side.
Health or anatomical problems with baby (including, jaundice, tongue-tie, etc.) can prevent baby from removing milk adequately from the breast, thus decreasing milk supply.vishnu1$Health or anatomical problems with baby (including, jaundice, tongue-tie, etc.) can prevent baby from removing milk adequately from the breast, thus decreasing milk supply.
Mom’s health (uncontrolled anemia or hypothyroidism, retained placenta, postpartum hemorrhage…), previous breast surgery/injury, hormonal problems (e.g. PCOS), anatomical problems, medications she is taking (hormonal birth control, sudafed…), or smoking also have the potential to affect milk supply.vishnu1$To speed milk production and increase overall milk supply, the key is to remove more milk from the breast and to do this frequently, so that less milk accumulates in the breast between feedings.
OK, now on to things that can help increase your milk supply:vishnu1$Make sure that baby is nursing efficiently. This is the “remove more milk” part of increasing milk production. If milk is not effectively removed from the breast, then mom’s milk supply decreases. If positioning and latch are “off” then baby is probably not transferring milk efficiently. A sleepy baby, use of nipple shields or various health or anatomical problems in baby can also interfere with baby’s ability to transfer milk. For a baby who is not nursing efficiently, trying to adequately empty milk from the breast is like trying to empty a swimming pool through a drinking straw – it can take forever. Inefficient milk transfer can lead to baby not getting enough milk or needing to nurse almost constantly to get enough milk. If baby is not transferring milk well, then it is important for mom to express milk after and/or between nursings to maintain milk supply while the breastfeeding problems are being addressed.vishnu1$Nurse frequently, and for as long as your baby is actively nursing. Remember – you want to remove more milk from the breasts and do this frequently. If baby is having weight gain problems, aim to nurse at least every 1.5-2 hours during the day and at least every 3 hours at night.
Take a nursing vacation. Take baby to bed with you for 2-3 days, and do nothing but nurse (frequently!) and rest (well, you can eat too!).
Offer both sides at each feeding. Let baby finish the first side, then offer the second side.vishnu1$Offer both sides at each feeding. Let baby finish the first side, then offer the second side.
Switch nurse. Switch sides 3 or more times during each feeding, every time that baby falls asleep, switches to “comfort” sucking, or loses interest. Use each side at least twice per feeding. Use breast compression to keep baby feeding longer. For good instructions on how to do this, see Dr. Jack Newman’s Protocol to manage breastmilk intake. This can be particularly helpful for sleepy or distractible babies.vishnu1$Avoid pacifiers and bottles when possible. All of baby’s sucking needs should be met at the breast (see above). If a temporary supplement is medically required, it can be given with a nursing supplementer or by spoon, cup or dropper (see Alternative Feeding Methods).
Give baby only breastmilk. Avoid all solids, water, and formula if baby is younger than six months, and consider decreasing solids if baby is older. If you are using more than a few ounces of formula per day, wean from the supplements gradually to “challenge” your breasts to produce more milk.vishnu1$Take care of mom. Rest. Sleep when baby sleeps. Relax. Drink liquids to thirst (don’t force liquids – drinking extra water does not increase supply), and eat a reasonably well-balanced diet.vishnu1$Consider pumping. Adding pumping sessions after or between nursing sessions can be very helpful – pumping is very important when baby is not nursing efficiently or frequently enough, and can speed things up in all situations. Your aim in pumping is to remove more milk from the breasts and/or to increase frequency of breast emptying. When pumping to increase milk supply, to ensure that the pump removes an optimum amount of milk from the breast, keep pumping for 2-5 minutes after the last drops of milk. However, adding even a short pumping session (increasing frequency but perhaps not removing milk thoroughly) is helpful.vishnu1$Consider a galactagogue. A substance (herb, prescription medication, etc.) that increases milk supply is called a galactagogue.
when should you start pumping breast milk :
Some new moms start pumping breast milk right after their baby is born — in the hospital or birthing center — to help initiate breastfeeding or to encourage their milk supply. It’s particularly important to get an early start on pumping if you’re unable to nurse your baby from birth — if your baby is premature, for instance, or has special needs.vishnu1$Other new moms will wait a few weeks before they start pumping. In the early days of breastfeeding, there is often precious little time between nursing sessions to pump, and lactation experts advise holding off on giving a bottle until breastfeeding is well established. (Plenty of babies, however, go back and forth between bottle and breast from day one, so do what works best for you and your family.)vishnu1$By the time baby is 4 to 6 weeks old, breastfeeding should be well-established, and you’ll likely have enough time between feeding sessions to pump extra milk that can be stored for later use. If you’re planning to go back to work, start pumping two to three weeks beforehand to get the hang of it and build up a stockpile of milk.
A few steps at the start of each pumping session can help ensure that you produce the most milk for your pumping buck.
First, always thoroughly wash your hands with soap and warm water before starting.vishnu1$First, always thoroughly wash your hands with soap and warm water before starting.
Get relaxed. Find a comfortable, quiet spot to sit and relax as much as possible: take some deep breaths, do a five-minute meditation, do some yoga stretches.
Encourage let-down. A soft breast massage or warm compress can get your breasts ready for let-down.vishnu1$Encourage let-down. A soft breast massage or warm compress can get your breasts ready for let-down.
Hold your baby close — in person, or in your imagination. If your baby is close by, a quick cuddle could help launch letdown (as long as she doesn't mind being this close to milk she’s not about to have). Away from home? Look at a photo of your baby, listen to a recording of her sounds or close your eyes and imagine her smell, her feel in your arms and her blissfully nursing face.
Create a good seal. You might find that it helps to moisten the flange with water to ensure a good seal.vishnu1$Create a good seal. You might find that it helps to moisten the flange with water to ensure a good seal.
Get centered. Center the nipple in the middle of the flange before starting the pump.
Prime the pump. Most electric pumps will begin with a letdown phase — shorter, faster bursts of suction that mimic the initial suckling your baby would do in order to stimulate letdown. It will take a few minutes until letdown happens and before then you’ll only get drops to a slow trickle of milk. After a few minutes (around the time letdown happens) the pump will switch into regular mode.vishnu1$Don’t default to the highest level of suction. You’ll want to start at a low suction and increase it when the milk starts flowing (but only to your level of comfort — pumping shouldn’t hurt and a higher suction doesn’t mean more milk!).
If you’re trying to build up your milk supply, pump in between nursing sessions when you’re with your baby. If you're pumping at work to replace feedings you’re missing, try to pump on the same schedule as your baby's feedings back at home so you keep your milk supply going strong and aligned with baby’s demand, usually every three to four hours.vishnu1$Aim to spend 15 to 20 minutes hooked up to the pump to net a good amount of breast milk (some women will need 30 minutes or more with the pump, especially in the early days). Pump until the milk starts slowing down and your breasts feel well-drained. Be sure to clean the breast flanges after every use.vishnu1$It takes about the same time to pump milk as it does to breastfeed. With practice, you may be able to pump in as little as 10 to 15 minutes. While you are at work, try to pump as often as your baby usually feeds. This may be every 3 to 4 hours for 15 minutes each time. To keep up your milk supply, give your baby extra feedings when you are together. You also can pump right after your baby feeds to help your breasts make more milk.vishnu1$There are a couple of ways you can store breast milk. You can use a plastic or glass bottle with a sealable top. Or you can use a sterile, sealable bag. Store your breast milk in the amount your baby consumes in a feeding. This way, you don’t waste any milk. For example, if your baby eats 4 ounces in a feeding, put 4 ounces of breast milk in the storage container. Always put a date on the container of breast milk so you know how long to keep it.vishnu1$Store your pumped breast milk in a refrigerator or cooler with ice as soon as possible. You also can freeze the milk if you aren’t going to use it right away.
The life of breast milk varies based on how it is stored.

Stored breast milk can vary in color. It can be bluish, yellowish, or brownish. It is normal for breast milk to separate (the fatty part of the milk goes to the top). Shake the bottle or sealed bag and the fat should go back into the milk. If it does not, then the breast milk may be bad. You should smell the milk before feeding it to your baby. Bad milk smells sour. If you still aren’t sure, try tasting the milk. If it tastes sour, then it is bad and needs to be thrown away.vishnu1$If you choose to freeze breast milk, you need to thaw it before giving it to your baby. There are 2 ways you can thaw the milk.
Put the container of milk in warm water. Swirl the container around in the water until the milk thaws.
Put the container of milk in the refrigerator the day before it is to be used.
Thawed breast milk can be refrigerated for up to 24 hours, but it should not be refrozen. Do not use hot water to thaw breast milk. The milk could get too hot and burn your baby’s mouth. Do not thaw frozen breast milk in a microwave. This can damage valuable proteins in breast milk.vishnu1$You may not get much milk when you first start pumping. This will change as you continue to pump regularly. Your breasts will begin to make more milk. The more often you pump, the more milk your breasts make. Drink lots of fluids to stay hydrated. This will also help your milk supply.vishnu1$If you plan to pump when you return to work, start practicing 1 or 2 weeks in advance. This helps you learn how your pump works. You can pump right after your baby eats or between feedings. Or you may prefer to pump from one breast while you feed your baby from the other.Starting at home also helps you build a collection of breast milk. You can store it for your baby’s feedings when you return to work.vishnu1$Once you’re ready to start breast pumping, there are a few things you need to know. If you have a full-term, healthy, breastfeeding baby, you can wait a few weeks to start pumping and storing breast milk. If your baby is preterm or ill and cannot breastfeed yet, or if you have chosen to exclusively pump, pump as soon as you can after birth, preferably within one to six hours of delivery. 
If you’re primarily breastfeeding:
Pump in the morning. Many moms get the most milk first thing in the morning.vishnu1$If you’re primarily breastfeeding:
Pump in the morning. Many moms get the most milk first thing in the morning.
Pump between breastfeeding, either 30-60 minutes after nursing or at least one hour before breastfeeding. This should leave plenty of milk for your baby at your next feeding.
If your baby wants to breastfeed right after breast pumping, let them! Some babies are patient and will just feed longer to get the milk they need.
f you’re exclusively breast pumping:
Plan to pump 8-10 times in a 24 hour period. Full milk production is typically 25-35 oz. (750-1,035 mL) per 24 hours.vishnu1$f you’re exclusively breast pumping:

Learning to pump can be a daunting process. These steps will set you and your baby up for success.
Do a little homework. Read up on the basics of breast pumping, and be sure to review your breast pump instructions.
Find a quiet, comfortable place to sit.
Bring a drink and a snack.
Plug in your pump or make sure it has working batteries.
Wash your hands with soap and water. 
Assemble the pump kit.
Center the flanges over your breast(s) and center the nipple in the flange opening, making an air seal. Flange fit is important!vishnu1$Wash your hands with soap and water. 
Assemble the pump kit.
Center the flanges over your breast(s) and center the nipple in the flange opening, making an air seal. Flange fit is important!
If you’re double pumping, cup each flange to the breast with fingers below the flange and thumb on the top.  When adjusting  your dials, switch to using one arm across both breasts, keeping an airtight seal.
Turn your pump on.vishnu1$Turn your pump on.
Similar to a baby nursing at the breast, start out with high speed and low suction until you see milk flow (let-down), then adjust speed to medium and increase suction based on comfort level.
Once milk flow decreases, increase speed to high until the next let-down, then decrease to medium speed.  
Keep going! You’ll find pumping gets quicker and easier with practice.vishnu1$Once milk flow decreases, increase speed to high until the next let-down, then decrease to medium speed.  
Keep going! You’ll find pumping gets quicker and easier with practice.
How much milk you should expect to pump will vary depending on factors such as your baby’s age, time since last feeding or pumping, time of day, pump type, how much practice you’ve had with your pump, and whether you’re relaxed or stressed.
If you’re primarily breastfeeding, on average, you can expect:
More milk production in the morning hours .
Volumes gradually decreasing during the day into the evening.vishnu1$If you’re primarily breastfeeding, on average, you can expect:

Breast milk volumes are dependent on many variables and each breast may produce different volumes.
If you’re exclusively pumping, on average, you should try maintain full milk production of about 25-35 oz. (750-1,035 mL) per 24 hours.  It may take some time to achieve this target, do not worry about hitting this on day one!vishnu1$Babies may take more milk from the bottle than when breastfeeding. The faster, steadier flow of the bottle causes some babies to take more than they need. A slow-flow bottle may help prevent overfeeding. 
If you’re pumping because your baby is preterm or too sick to breastfeed, or because you have chosen to exclusively pump, follow these tips to reach and maintain full milk production. Pumping often to drain the breast completely sends a signal to the body to produce more milk. The more often you drain your breasts the more milk they will make.
From Birth to Day 4vishnu1$From Birth to Day 4
If you can, start pumping within six hours after birth.
Use a multi-user pump to initiate and maintain milk supply.
Expect to pump just a little colostrum (the first milk) at first.
As soon as possible, pump 8-10 times every 24 hours. This is how many times each day your baby would typically feed from the breast.  In most cases, the more times each day you pump, the more milk you make. The reverse is true, too. Pumping  fewer times will produce less milk.
Double pump (pump both breasts at once); this saves time and may boost production more quickly.vishnu1$Double pump (pump both breasts at once); this saves time and may boost production more quickly.
Pump at least 10-20 minutes, until your milk comes in on Day 3 or 4. Then, hand express any remaining milk. Remove and place the breast flange under your breast to collect the milk you hand express. (The hand expression helps to better drain your breast, and drained breasts make milk faster.)
To help establish milk supply, pump at least twice between 1 to 6am. In early morning hours milk- making hormone levels increase and taking advantage of this will increase your milk production.vishnu1$To help establish milk supply, pump at least twice between 1 to 6am.

From Day 4 to Full Production
When your milk increases from drops to ounces on about day 4, make these changes:
Pump longer, two minutes after the last drop of milk or until your breasts are softened/no longer feel full.
Focus on the total number of pumpings each day (8-10 times per 24 hours) rather than the time between pumpings (every 2-3 hours).vishnu1$Focus on the total number of pumpings each day (8-10 times per 24 hours) rather than the time between pumpings (every 2-3 hours).
Don’t allow more than one five-hour period to pass without pumping during your baby’s first two weeks of life.
Many moms find it easier to focus on their daily total rather than pumping at a set time each day. This daily total also seems to be most important to your milk production.
When you reach 25-35 oz. (750-1,050 mL) per baby per 24 hour period, you’ve met your goal. Most moms can then pump fewer times each day and maintain production. At this stage:vishnu1$When you reach 25-35 oz. (750-1,050 mL) per baby per 24 hour period, you’ve met your goal. Most moms can then pump fewer times each day and maintain production. At this stage:
Maintain a schedule that continues producing approximately 25-35oz of breastmilk in a 24 hour period.
While maintaining your optimal production of milk, you can try and sleep more. Once full production is developed, many moms pump right before bed and first thing in the morning. See if you can do this without too much breast fullness or a decrease in milk production.vishnu1$Pump for a shorter period of time. For many moms, 10-15 minutes of pumping is long enough.
Once a week, add up the milk you pump in a 24-hour period. Write it down and compare your totals each week. You’ll know right away if your production drops.
f you need to boost milk production, the sooner you work on it, the faster you’ll see results. Some ideas to try are:

There are a couple of ways to wean from the pump:vishnu1$When you decide to wean from the pump, remember the safest and most comfortable weaning is almost always a gradual one. There are a couple of ways to wean from the pump:
Drop one daily pumping. Give your body two to three days to adjust. Then drop another daily pumping. Leave your first and last daily pumpings until the end. Repeat until you’re fully weaned from the pump.vishnu1$Keep the number of pumpings the same but pump for a shorter period of time. For example, if you were getting 4 oz. (120 mL) at each pumping, stop after 3 oz. (90 mL). Give your body two to three days to adjust and then do it again. Repeat until you no longer feel the need to pump.
While weaning, if your breasts ever feel full, pump just long enough to make yourself comfortable. Letting your breasts stay too full puts you at risk for pain and infection.vishnu1$While weaning, if your breasts ever feel full, pump just long enough to make yourself comfortable. Letting your breasts stay too full puts you at risk for pain and infection.
Power pumping boosts your milk supply by mimicking a baby's “cluster feeding,” a term for a period during which your baby feeds more frequently than usual (usually because of a growth spurt). Both are thought to ramp up the production of prolactin, a hormone that stimulates breast milk production.vishnu1$You can do power pumping instead of a feeding session (for example, you’re at work or otherwise away from your baby for a few hours). Otherwise, do it right after a breastfeeding session. Ideally, your power pumping session should last an hour.
A power pump schedule might look like this:
Pump for 20 minutes
Rest for 10 minutes

If you don’t have a full hour, then aim for two 30-minute sessions where you pump for 10 minutes, rest for five, pump for five, rest for five and then pump for another five. Then pump or nurse as usual the rest of the day.
It will take a few days for your milk supply to respond to this increased demand: some moms see an increase within three days, while others will need to power pump for a week before seeing results.vishnu1$It will take a few days for your milk supply to respond to this increased demand: some moms see an increase within three days, while others will need to power pump for a week before seeing results.
There are many reasons why a mom would pump her breast milk, from relieving engorgement and boosting milk supply to collecting milk for feedings when you’re away from your little one (such as when you return to work).vishnu1$If you pump and store your milk, you can continue to give your baby the benefits that come from breast milk long after you’ve stopped nursing. And for moms who want to feed their babies breast milk but can’t nurse for some reason (poor latch, for instance, or low supply), pumping ensures they can still offer their baby that liquid gold.
No matter the reason you do it, pumping has a number of benefits:
You’ll be able to go back to work (or go out for the night, take a vacation or travel for business) and still give your baby breast milk.vishnu1$You’ll be able to go back to work (or go out for the night, take a vacation or travel for business) and still give your baby breast milk.
You don’t have to be the only one responsible for feeding your little one — a partner or caregiver can help, too.
Pumping allows you to build your milk supply even before baby needs more milk, thereby allowing you to store the extra for later down the road.
Pumping gives you the opportunity to donate your extra milk to moms who can’t breastfeed their babies themselves but want to give their little ones the benefits of breast milk.vishnu1$For most women, there usually comes a day (or night) where they need to be away from their baby, whether it’s for work, school, travel or just out for an evening. Consider it the law of busy motherhood: your baby and breasts aren’t always at the same place at the same time. You still may nurse baby, say, in the mornings before work, and evenings and weekends when you’re home, but she gets pumped breast milk for those times that you’re not around.vishnu1$Some women, however, have no choice but to pump exclusively, because despite all their best efforts, they can’t nurse due to circumstances such as the baby has trouble latching. In this case, you may opt to pump exclusively, otherwise known as “EPing."vishnu1$If you do decide to EP (and kudos to you, it’s no small feat!) then you’ll need to invest in a good double electric pump, which saves you time and also is the most effective way to pump up your milk supply. Experts also recommend trying to mimic a newborn baby’s schedule as much as possible, at least at the beginning. That can be up to eight to 12 times in a 24-hour day, or every two to three hours for 15-20 minutes at a time.
As your milk supply becomes more established, you may find that you can space out the pumping for longer, at least at night.vishnu1$Cleaning your pump after each use is important to ensure germs don’t multiply and harm your little one. So be sure to wash all the pump parts that have come into contact with the breast or breast milk with liquid soap and hot water, scrubbing them with a cleaning brush and rinsing under running water.When washing by hand, be sure to use a clean wash basin — not the kitchen sink — that is only used for washing infant feeding equipment, and do not place the components of the pump in the sink. Air-dry and put the parts away only when they are completely dry. If your baby is less than 3 months or, born prematurely, or has a weakened immune system, sanitize daily.If your breast pumps parts are dishwasher-safe, place them in the top rack of a dishwasher and put it on a hot water and heated drying cycle.vishnu1$Maintaining your breast milk supply while pumping :
Remember the rules of breastfeeding supply and demand: The more demand there is (in this case in the form of pumping), the more supply (in the form of breast milk) there will be. Which means that if you’re looking to maintain your milk supply you should be pumping at the same rate that your baby would be feeding directly from you, making sure your breasts are well drained at each session.
A few more strategies that can help you maintain your milk supply while pumping:vishnu1$A few more strategies that can help you maintain your milk supply while pumping:
Relax. When you feel happy and relaxed, your body produces oxytocin, the hormone that signals that it’s time for the milk in your breasts to be released (letdown). Research has found that moms who listened to guided relaxation or soothing music while pumping had an increased pumping output — and that those who also looked at photos of their babies pumped even more.vishnu1$Get handsy. As you pump, compress and massage both breasts. Continue until milk flow slows to a trickle, then massage your breasts again, focusing on any areas that feel full. When no more milk is expressed via the pump, finish with a few minutes of hand expression, where you do intense breast compression on both breasts to ensure you’ve drained both as fully as possible.vishnu1$Take a look inside your medicine cabinet. Some types of birth control pills may decrease milk supply for some moms (consider a switch to another birth control method if that’s the case for you), as can the decongestant pseudoephedrine (found in Sudafed). If you’re congested, stick with non-medicinal methods to relieve the stuffiness, such as sinus rinses, steam or saline nasal sprays.vishnu1$Increasing your milk supply will take time, so don’t give up. Even dry pumps (when you pump but nothing comes out) sends a signal to your body that more milk is needed on tap, so it’s getting the work done even if there’s no output to show for it right away. Stick with it and you’ll see the results after a few days. Newborns generally sleep 12 to 16 hours in a 24-hour period and do not know the difference between day and night.Your newborn will sleep a lot from 0 - 3 months. Newborns need regular feeding, so they usually sleep in short periods. Newborns sleep in short bursts, known as sleep cycles which are usually around 20 to 50 minutes long. In the first 3 months of life, babies cry a lot – it is their main way of communicating.From approximately 2 weeks to 3-4 months of age, newborns go through a stage of increased crying, which will be at its worst at 6-8 weeks of age.Sleep cycles means your newborn sleeps many times in the day and night and for short amounts of time. For example, one sleep cycle goes for 20 - 50 minutes.In one sleep cycle there is active sleep - Active sleep means your newborn moves around or makes noises. quiet sleep - Quiet sleep means your newborn stays still and breathes deeper.The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recommends a total sleep duration of 14 to 17 hours a day from birth to three months; 12 to 15 hours a day from four to 11 months; and 11 to 14 hours a day for infants aged one to two years. Sleep problems during infancy have been shown to be associated with subsequent sleep problems during early childhood, which in turn are linked to behavioural and learning problems.vishnu1$Your newborn will wake up many times in the day and night. Your baby will start to learn sleep rhythms after 3 months of age. Sleep rhythms means your newborn will start to learn when it is day and night. To help your newborn learn a sleep rhythm, you can play gently in the day when it is light , make it dark and quiet at night when it is time to sleep.
Babies go through several sleeping patterns and stages as they grow and develop. Here are some common sleeping patterns observed in babies:vishnu1$Babies go through several sleeping patterns and stages as they grow and develop. Here are some common sleeping patterns observed in babies:
Newborns (0-3 months): Newborn babies tend to sleep for most of the day, typically 14-17 hours in a 24-hour period. However, their sleep is usually fragmented into short periods, ranging from a few minutes to a few hours. They have no set sleep-wake cycles and may wake frequently for feeding, diaper changes, or comfort.vishnu1$Infants (3-6 months): As infants grow, they start developing more regular sleep patterns. They may sleep for 13-15 hours a day, including nighttime sleep and naps. During this stage, they begin to develop longer periods of consolidated nighttime sleep and may sleep for 6-8 hours at a stretch. Daytime naps usually decrease to 2-3 naps per day.vishnu1$Older infants (6-12 months): By this stage, babies typically sleep for around 12-14 hours a day, with nighttime sleep becoming more continuous. Most infants can sleep through the night without needing a feeding. They may have 2-3 daytime naps, with each nap lasting around 1-2 hours.
Toddlerhood (1-3 years): Toddlers generally require around 11-14 hours of sleep, including nighttime sleep and a single daytime nap. Nighttime sleep becomes more consistent, usually lasting 10-12 hours. Daytime naps reduce to one nap, usually occurring in the afternoon and lasting 1-3 hours.vishnu1$It's important to note that every baby is unique, and individual sleep patterns can vary. Some babies may require more or less sleep than the average ranges mentioned above. Additionally, sleep patterns can be influenced by various factors such as growth spurts, developmental milestones, teething, illness, and environmental factors.
Establishing a consistent sleep routine, creating a conducive sleep environment, and promoting healthy sleep habits can help babies develop good sleeping patterns and promote better sleep for both the baby and caregivers.vishnu1$It is normal for your newborn to cry a lot. Crying is how newborns can tell you something. Many newborns can cry for around 3 hours per day. Sometimes you will not know why your newborn cries or what they want to tell you. It is ok if you find it hard to stop your newborn from crying.
Feeding can help newborns sleep.vishnu1$Feeding can help newborns sleep.
Feeding means you give your newborn breastmilk or formula. Sleep will not change if your newborn has breast milk or formula. Your newborn will need to be fed many times in the day and night. Every newborn feeds in a different way. You will work out the best way to feed your newborn in the day and night.

Infant sleep plays an important role in a child's development, including cognition and physical growth – it's associated with overall cognitive development, as well as specific cognitive functions such as memory, language and executive function.
The importance of slumbervishnu1$Babies are born with no established circadian rhythm and it will be developed only when they are about three to four months old. This explains why your child may sleep in the day and not at night (much to your despair). Parents can help this process by exposing babies to natural light cues in the day, and similarly provide a dark environment at night. This helps junior to distinguish day (light) from night (dark).Sleep in the first year of life is imperative as it is an important period for maturation of sleep, with consolidation of nocturnal sleep and decrease in day sleep duration. Infant sleep plays an important role in a child’s development, including cognition and physical growth – it’s associated with overall cognitive development, as well as specific cognitive functions such as memory, language and executive function. Sufficient and quality sleep may favour optimal cognitive function in children because it helps with brain maturation and memory consolidation. Slow wave sleep – often referred to as deep sleep – plays an important role in memory consolidation, which may be important during early language acquisition.vishnu1$"Growth hormone is also released during slow wave sleep, contributing to gain in body length". Short sleep duration in infants have been reported to be linked to adiposity and obesity later in life.1,2 Sleep deprivation is associated with increased ghrelin (hunger hormone) and decreased leptin (satiety hormone), resulting in increased caloric intake leading to adiposity.vishnu1$Infant sleep plays an important role in their overall development and well-being. Sleep is crucial for babies as it supports their growth, physical health, brain development, and emotional well-being. The reasons why sleep is so important for babies.
Growth Hormone Secretion: During deep sleep, infants produce growth hormones, which are essential for their physical growth and development. These hormones promote the growth of bones, muscles, and tissues. Sufficient sleep helps support optimal growth in babies.vishnu1$Brain Development: Sleep is closely linked to brain development in infants. During sleep, the brain consolidates and processes the information and experiences acquired during wakefulness. It is a critical time for the formation of neural connections, which strengthen memory, language skills, and executive functions.
Memory Consolidation: Sleep plays a vital role in memory consolidation. It helps babies store and retain information they have learned throughout the day. During deep sleep, the brain processes and strengthens memories, allowing for better recall and learning in the future.vishnu1$Emotional Regulation: Adequate sleep is essential for promoting emotional well-being in babies. It helps regulate emotions, reduces irritability, and contributes to a positive mood. Sufficient sleep allows babies to handle daily challenges with improved emotional resilience.
Immune System Function: Sleep is crucial for a healthy immune system. During sleep, the body produces cytokines, a type of protein that helps fight off infections, inflammation, and illness. Sufficient sleep strengthens the immune system and reduces the risk of infections and diseases in infants.vishnu1$Appetite and Weight Regulation: Sleep plays a role in regulating appetite and metabolism in babies. Lack of sleep can disrupt the balance of hormones involved in hunger and satiety, leading to increased appetite and potential weight gain. Sufficient sleep helps maintain a healthy appetite and supports proper weight management.vishnu1$Cognitive Function and Learning: Sleep is closely associated with cognitive function and learning in infants. It enhances attention, concentration, and problem-solving abilities. Good quality sleep allows babies to be more alert, focused, and receptive to new information and learning experiences.
Restorative and Healing Processes: Sleep provides a time for the body to rest, repair, and heal. It allows the body to conserve energy, promote tissue growth and repair, and support overall physical well-being in infants.vishnu1$In conclusion, sleep is incredibly important for babies as it contributes to their growth, brain development, emotional well-being, physical health, and learning abilities. Establishing healthy sleep habits early on is crucial for optimal development and overall well-being. As caregivers, it is essential to prioritize and create a conducive sleep environment for babies, ensuring they get the sleep they need for healthy development.vishnu1$Babies experiencing separation anxiety will fear that a parent will leave and not return. The fear may be worsened in the presence of a stranger. Typical responses of babies experiencing this normal phase of development may include the following: Crying when you leave the room.Separation anxiety refers to the anxiety a baby or young child experiences when their caregiver leaves them, such as when they drop them off at daycare or leave for work. Babies and toddlers experiencing separation anxiety will become more clingy than usual, and may cry when their caregiver tries to leave.vishnu1$Separation anxiety in babies and toddlers is common, and a normal stage in childhood development. Children with separation anxiety may cry and become clingy when caregivers leave, even if only for a few moments.It can be difficult to part from babies who experience this anxiety, but there are ways that parents and caregivers can reduce the distress. Typically, babies and toddlers grow out of separation anxiety as they get older.Babies can show signs of separation anxiety as early as 4–5 months. Usually, though, more robust separation anxiety begins when they are about 9 months old. Some infants do not experience separation anxiety until they are slightly older, while some do not experience it at all.vishnu1$causes of separation anxiety in babies :vishnu1$Separation anxiety occurs when babies begin to learn object permanence. Object permanence is the understanding that people and objects continue to exist, even when the baby cannot see them.Babies begin to understand this when they are 6–12 months old. However, because they do not have an understanding of time, they do not know when their caregiver will come back. This causes them to become afraid and agitated.When children become more independent during toddlerhood, they may develop a greater awareness of separation from their caregiver. This may result in them going through another phase of separation anxiety.In many cases, separation anxiety will fade naturally as a child gets older.vishnu1$However, certain factors can trigger or exacerbate separation anxiety, such as:
the arrival of a new sibling,
a new or unfamiliar childcare setting,
a new caregiver,
moving home,
the loss of a parent or caregiver,
extended absences from a caregiver, for example, due to military deployment,
the stress of a caregiver, which the infant may pick up on,
feeling tired, hungry, or unwell,vishnu1$extended absences from a caregiver, for example, due to military deployment,

The best way to approach separation anxiety is to address the anxiety and fear the infant feels. This can help them feel more comfortable with separation over time. To handle separation anxiety in the daytime :vishnu1$Cuddle and comfort the child regularly- Foster secure attachment by spending time holding and cuddling the infant each day, and comfort them when they are afraid or upset.
Practice brief separations- Practice leaving the baby in a safe place before going into another room. Return after a brief separation. This teaches the baby that their caregiver can go away, but will still come back.While away, people can talk or sing to the baby so they know their caregiver is still nearby, even while out of sight.vishnu1$Play games to encourage separation- Peek-a-boo is a good activity to help babies learn that even when someone is out of sight, they still exist and will come back. Similarly, caregivers can try covering and uncovering toys with a blanket.Toddlers may get similar benefits from playing hide-and-seek with caregivers.
Foster independence- Give babies and toddlers the opportunity to crawl away from the caregiver into another safe room, while maintaining supervision from nearby. This will help them develop independence on their terms, and help them understand that it is safe to do so.vishnu1$Develop a routine- A regular routine provides a reliable and stable pattern to the day. Routine is important for children, as it provides consistency and reduces the stress of the unknown.
Introduce new caregivers gradually- Give babies and toddlers time to get to know new caregivers, such as other relatives or daycare workers. Before beginning daycare, for example, someone could schedule introductory sessions to help the infant get used to new people.vishnu1$Explain what is happening and return on time- “I will be back after your nap to take you home.” When leaving an infant with someone else, caregivers should explain that they are going away for a little while but that they will come back. As the baby gets older, they will begin to understand these explanations.It can also be helpful to provide a timeframe. When doing this, be specific so that the child knows exactly when to expect a return. For example, a caregiver could say, “I will be back after your nap to take you home.”It is important to return on time, as returning later can cause a child not to trust what the caregiver says.vishnu1$Never sneak away- While it may be tempting to sneak away without the infant noticing, it can cause problems long term. The infant may develop a constant worry that their caregiver could disappear at any time, which worsens separation anxiety.Saying goodbye lets the infant know what to expect, and builds trust that a caregiver will not leave without telling them.vishnu1$Keep goodbyes brief and upbeat- Drawn-out goodbyes can prolong distress, so keep goodbyes brief and positive. It may help to create a goodbye ritual, such as a special handshake, or providing the child with a special blanket or toy to comfort them.
It is OK to comfort a child who is experiencing separation anxiety, but do not linger. Give them full attention and affection, and then leave.vishnu1$It is OK to comfort a child who is experiencing separation anxiety, but do not linger. Give them full attention and affection, and then leave.
To handle separation anxiety at night: Providing comfort and reassurance during the day may help ease nighttime separations. However, often a little extra support is necessary at bedtime to help children feel secure before they fall asleep.It may help to:
stick to a bedtime routine

Separation anxiety typically peaks by the age of 3 yearsTrusted Source and begins to fade as the child develops a greater understanding that their caregiver will return. However, some children can continue to experience separation anxiety for longer periods.vishnu1$When separation anxiety persists into later childhood, it is known as childhood separation anxiety disorder (CSAD). This is a mental health condition that causes a level of separation anxiety that is unusual for the child’s stage of development.
CSAD may lead toTrusted Source a refusal to go to school, or skipping school. It can also prevent children from participating in activities with others. Children with CSAD may:
verbally ask a caregiver not to leave
be reluctant to go to preschool or school
avoid staying at other people’s homes
become withdrawn or sadvishnu1$verbally ask a caregiver not to leave

Researchers estimate that CSAD affects approximately 1–4% of children in the United States. Separation anxiety can also affect adults.
Caregivers should seek support from a doctor, or a pediatrician, if they have concerns about their child’s separation anxiety. It is especially important to get support when separation anxiety:
is intense or prolonged
interferes with school or activities
causes panic attacksvishnu1$is intense or prolonged

Caregivers can also develop separation anxiety. If this happens, it can be helpful to speak with a counselor or psychotherapist, who can help someone understand their feelings and how to work through them.vishnu1$Separation anxiety in babies is a normal part of their development, and one they usually grow out of as they get older. It can be distressing for caregivers and infants, but there are many ways to cope.Connection, communication, and play all help foster a sense of security. Being consistent and sticking to routines can help children understand that when a caregiver leaves, they will come back.If separation anxiety seems severe or prolonged, caregivers should discuss their concerns with a doctor, or a pediatrician.vishnu1$Sleep regressions are the phenomena when your once good (or even just “OK”) sleeper all of a sudden doesn't sleep well anymore. The term “sleep regression” refers to a period of time when a baby or toddler experiences a shift in their sleeping pattern.Multiple wake-ups, increased fussing and crying at uncommon times, or even fighting bedtime can happen in babies who had been sleeping soundly through the night.Like most things regarding babies and toddlers, sleep regressions can vary in when they happen and how long they last. However, many specialists seem to agree the most common regressions happen around 4 months, 6 months, 8 months, 12 months, 18 months, and 2 years of age and last between 2 and 6 weeks.Sleep regression is usually temporary. It may go away just as fast as it came on, or it may last for a few weeks or months. In some cases, sleep training may help get things back on track sooner.Typically, these regressions are associated with the various developmental milestones a baby experiences around those ages, such as learning to sit up, crawl, and walk. Other causes include separation anxiety, big life changes, and a desire for independence.vishnu1$Here are some signs your baby may be going through a sleep regression: More frequent night waking. Trouble falling asleep at bedtime. Increased fussiness or crankiness.

There is not much current and formal research on infant sleep regressions. However, some older research suggests regressions are responses to the developmental changes babies experience during the first couple years of life.vishnu1$For example, an older study from 1991 suggests that periods of change in sleep patterns and behavior often coincide. Likewise, a 2002 case report found that sleep regressions may happen alongside the developmental brain changes that happen roughly between 2 and 21 months of age.
That said, it seems sleep regressions may happen for various reasons, including:
developmental milestones (learning to crawl, walk, talk)
needing to transition to one nap per day
separation anxiety
growing desire for independence
life changes (potty training, moving from crib to bed, getting a sibling)vishnu1$needing to transition to one nap per day

However, sometimes, what looks like a sleep regression is actually more of a sleep disruption due to growing pains, teething, hunger, and reflux. Additionally, a baby may have trouble falling and staying asleep because they have not established solid sleeping habits.vishnu1$Typically, the 4-month sleep regression is the first sleep pattern change babies experience.However, not all babies experience it. For those who do, it might come a month or so earlier or later.Signs of 4-month sleep regression include:
changes in nap routines
waking more frequently at night
restless sleep
trouble falling back asleepvishnu1$changes in nap routines
waking more frequently at night
restless sleep
trouble falling back asleep
Generally speaking, the 4-month sleep regression is less of a regression and more the beginning of a permanent change in a baby’s sleep pattern. Around this time, babies start sleeping more like adults and less like infants, so this “regression” is typically like a springboard into more mature sleeping patterns.
6-month sleep regressionvishnu1$There is some debate about the 6-month sleep regression, specifically as to whether it actually exists.Some argue that sleep disturbances around this age do not last long enough to qualify as a true sleep regression.Generally, babies around this age wake at night because they are hungry. Maybe they are breastfed and still need a night feeding, or maybe they need to replenish the calories they burned during the day practicing their scooting, crawling, and sitting up skills.On the other hand, some claim the 6-month sleep regression is a true regression, though they admit it is a short-lived one. Additionally, these advisors add newfound skills, teething, and separation anxiety to the list of causes.Regardless of phrasing or reasoning, the signs are the same: waking at night, fussiness, and longer daytime naps.vishnu1$This stage is also called the 8- to 10-month sleep regression because it may happen any time during that age range.As with most sleep regressions, this one seems to coincide with developmental changes such as learning to pull themselves to a standing position or crawl.Also, some babies get their central incisor teeth between 8 and 12 months, which may contribute to this sleeplessness. Anyone concerned about teething may ask a pediatrician for advice.
12-month sleep regressionvishnu1$12-month sleep regression
There is not much mystery surrounding the 12-month sleep regression. For some babies, it might happen as early as 11 months, or blend in with an 11-month regression. For some babies it might not even happen at all.Similar to most sleep regressions, the 12-month sleep regression seems to happen due to the baby’s growing skills, and awareness of the world around them.Caregivers keep babies on a regular bedtime routine, to help this regression pass.vishnu1$18-month sleep regression says : It is safe to say toddlers go through many changes around the middle of their second year, and some of those changes contribute to the 18-month sleep regression.One change relates to the toddler’s circadian rhythms — more specifically, the 24-hour sleep-wake cycle.Babies begin establishing a sleep-wake cycle during the first 4 months of lifeTrusted Source. However, rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) change over a person’s lifetime, including the first 5 years of life.This may cause some toddlers to start fighting their usual bedtime. Both REM and NREM are sleep phases that are important for various mental and physical processes.Additionally, some toddlers go through the 18-month sleep regression because they are dealing with separation anxiety and do not want to be away from their caregivers.At the same time, toddlers around this age begin wanting more independence. They want to stay awake so they can practice their growing skills and explore the world around them.vishnu1$Typically, the 2-year sleep regression is the last one.
Causes may include:
life changes such as potty training or moving to a toddler bed
return of separation anxiety
night terrors, nightmares, and nighttime fear (think “monster under the bed”)
There are a few ways caregivers can help ease this regression, including:
initiating one life change at a time (e.g. toddler bed and then potty training, or vice versa)
increasing wake time between the afternoon nap and bedtime
teaching skills to cope with nighttime fear
Additionally, the toddler may experience a nap regression.vishnu1$increasing wake time between the afternoon nap and bedtime
teaching skills to cope with nighttime fear
Additionally, the toddler may experience a nap regression.
Generally, toddlers this age take an afternoon nap. Some may start resisting this nap, confusing caregivers into thinking they are ready to stop napping. However, typically the afternoon nap lasts through and sometimes beyond toddlerhood, and caregivers may treat this resistance as a regression.vishnu1$A sleep regression is an abrupt change in an infant’s sleeping pattern, and many babies experience several stages of sleep regression during the first 2 years of life.Typically, these sleep regressions are connected to the baby’s developmental changes, though other factors, such as teething, can influence shifts in their sleeping habits.
" For the most part, sleep regressions stop after around the 2-year mark."vishnu1$Around 1 in 10 young children have a reaction when they drink cow's milk. This could be because they have a lactose intolerance or a milk allergy. Milk allergy is much more common than lactose intolerance in children under 5 years of age.Cows' milk allergy (CMA), also called cows' milk protein allergy, is one of the most common childhood food allergies. It is estimated to affect around 7% of babies under 1, though most children grow out of it.CMA typically develops when cows' milk is first introduced into your baby's diet either in formula or when your baby starts eating solids.vishnu1$There are 2 main types of CMA: Immediate CMA – where symptoms typically begin within minutes of having cows' milk. Delayed CMA – where symptoms typically begin several hours, or even days, after having cows' milk.
One of the test for lactose intolerant is Hydrogen breath test.Your child drinks a liquid that has a lot of lactose. The breath is then checked at regular times to measure the amount of hydrogen. High levels of hydrogen mean your child is lactose intolerant.vishnu1$Also to know if my baby is lactose intolerant or allergic to milk check for any skin reactions – such as an itchy rash or swelling of the lips, face and around the eyes. digestive problems – such as stomach ache, vomiting, colic, diarrhoea or constipation. hay fever-like symptoms – such as a runny or blocked nose. eczema that does not improve with treatment.

Lactose intolerance is another type of reaction to milk, when the body cannot digest lactose, a natural sugar found in milk. However, this is not an allergy.Lactose intolerance can be temporary – for example, it can come on for a few days or weeks after a tummy bug.
Symptoms of lactose intolerance include: diarrhoea,vomiting,stomach rumbling and pains,wind.vishnu1$Symptoms of lactose intolerance include: diarrhoea,vomiting,stomach rumbling and pains,wind.
Symptoms of lactose intolerance can start a few minutes, or a few hours, after having food or drink containing lactose.
Common symptoms of lactose intolerance include: tummy pain or discomfort,bloating,farting,diarrhoea or,constipation,feeling sick or being sick. You may also have longer lasting symptoms including a rash (eczema), headaches, joint pain, feeling tired, and finding it hard to concentrate.
Foods that contain lactose:vishnu1$Foods that contain lactose:
Lactose is found in foods containing animal milk (dairy products), includes milk from cows, goats and sheep.
Dairy products include: milk,butter,cheese,cream,yoghurt,ice cream.
Many processed foods can also contain lactose, including:cereals,baked foods like ,bread,crackers, cakes, biscuits, and pastry,sauces and salad dressings,diet and protein shakes.
Lactose intolerance is a problem with the digestive system — it means your child doesn't have the enzyme needed to digest lactose, which is the sugar naturally present in milk.vishnu1$Lactose intolerance is a problem with the digestive system — it means your child doesn't have the enzyme needed to digest lactose, which is the sugar naturally present in milk.
Milk allergy, however, is a problem with the immune system, where the body reacts to the protein in milk. An allergy usually involves other parts of the body as well as the stomach and may cause symptoms such as a skin rash or swelling of the face.
Many young children grow out of their intolerance or allergy. But don’t start giving them milk until your doctor tells you it’s safe to do so.

Tests for lactose intolerance
If your GP thinks you have lactose intolerance, you may:

If your symptoms are severe and do not get better, you may need a gastroscopy. This is where a long, thin, flexible tube is passed into your mouth and down into your stomach. A very small sample of cells may be taken from your small intestine so it can be tested.
Before the test, you may be given painkillers to help with any discomfort, and a sedative to help you relax.

Treatment for lactose intolerance
For most people with lactose intolerance, the symptoms can be prevented by reducing the amount of food you eat that contains lactose, or by avoiding these foods completely.
If you think your child is lactose intolerant, see your GP before removing dairy products from their diet.
Taking a lactase supplement before having food or drink containing lactose may reduce or prevent symptoms for some people.vishnu1$Taking a lactase supplement before having food or drink containing lactose may reduce or prevent symptoms for some people.
In some people, lactose intolerance is caused by another health condition, such as coeliac disease. Treating the underlying cause should help.
Causes of lactose intolerance
The most common cause of lactose intolerance is when the body does not make enough of an enzyme called lactase, which helps you digest lactose.
Lactose intolerance can start at any age and can also be caused by:
conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and Coeliac disease
bowel infectionsvishnu1$Lactose intolerance can start at any age and can also be caused by:
conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and Coeliac disease
bowel infections
bowel surgery
an injury to the bowel
Some premature babies are unable to digest lactose because their bowel has not developed enough, but this usually gets better as your baby gets older.
Some people do not make any lactase at all, but this is very rare.

A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) is a medical emergency. Call 999 for an ambulance immediately if you think your child has anaphylaxis (even if they start to feel better).
If your baby is diagnosed with CMA, you'll be offered advice by your GP or an allergy specialist on how to manage their allergy. You may also be referred to a dietitian.vishnu1$Treatment involves removing all cows' milk from your child's diet for a period of time. If your baby is formula-fed, your GP can prescribe special infant formula.Do not give your child any other type of milk without first getting medical advice.If your baby is exclusively breastfed, the mother will be advised to avoid all cows' milk products.Your child should be assessed around every 6 to 18 months to see if they have grown out of their allergy.Cluster feeding is a time when your baby wants lots of short feeds over a few hours. It's normal and often happens in the early days of breastfeeding. Cluster feeding is a normal behaviour for your baby. It's more common in the late afternoon or early evening, but it can happen anytime of the day.Cluster feeding, or frequent feedings with only short breaks between, can be typical newborn behavior. Certain practices, such as staying hydrated and planning ahead, may help you manage it.vishnu1$Cluster feeding is when a baby suddenly starts eating much more frequently — in clusters — for a period of time. It usually lasts a couple of hours at a time and differs from your baby’s usual eating behavior.Cluster feeding is normal baby behavior, seen primarily in breastfeeding newborns in the first few weeks. It doesn’t necessarily mean there’s anything wrong with your baby or your milk supply.
Cluster feeding can be hard to identify because newborns rarely have a predictable eating or sleeping schedule.

Cluster feeding is more common in the evenings. With an older infant, though, there may be several days in a row when they eat a lot more than usual throughout the entire day. This may be due to growth spurts or teething.vishnu1$Every baby is different, but a typical feeding session for a baby that isn’t cluster feeding can range from 10 to 30 minutes. Experts advise to feed your newborn baby an average of at least 8 to 12 times in 24 hours. Your baby may show hunger signs and need to eat more frequently.
Frequent feeding may help:
prevent jaundice
promote healthy weight gain in babies
mothers develop a milk supply
Cluster feeding vs. colicvishnu1$If your baby is fussier than usual, you might wonder if they have colic. Colic is similar to cluster feeding in that it can come on suddenly and often occurs in the evening.A baby with colic usually can’t be soothed with nursing or formula. However, a cluster feeding baby will be soothed during nursing sessions.Colic is defined as at least three hours of crying for at least three days a week, at least three weeks in a row. It affects 10 to 40 percentTrusted Source of all babies worldwide. There’s no difference in risk between male or female babies, nor between breastfed or formula-fed babies.vishnu1$Colic symptoms include:
crying that sounds more like screaming
face and body that appears tense or contorted
crying at a predictable time each day, often in the evenings
crying that peaks at six weeks and usually passes by 3 months oldvishnu1$Researchers don’t fully understand why babies cluster feed, but there are many unproven theories. Cluster feeding probably meets a combination of needs that your baby has at this developmental stage.Heather Turgeon, MFT, a psychotherapist and author of The Happy Sleeper, says, “cluster feeding is likely a way for babies, who have maturing nervous systems, to regulate. It could also be a way to store up on food for the night.“What we do know about breastfeeding is that it’s a supply and demand system. When little babies want to feed, that’s a good sign that we should let them, because trying to schedule or space feedings out doesn’t give that supply and demand system the right feedback.“So while we can have theories about why they cluster feed, what matters is that we let them do it — that’s the way to establish and maintain mom’s milk supply.” Cluster feeding can be exhausting and you may hear people stressing the importance of a schedule for baby, but cluster feeding is a normal part of the development of many babies.vishnu1$More frequent eating shouldn’t cause worry about your milk supply. A doctor can easily tell you if your baby is getting enough milk based on their weight gain.
the average number of wet diapers per day based on the baby's age:
number of wet diapers for Newborn:Average wet diapers per day: 1 to 2
During the first few days of life, newborns often have only one wet diaper per day. This is because their tiny stomachs can hold only a small amount of milk, and they have frequent bowel movements.
number of wet diapers for 4 to 5 days old:Average wet diapers per day: 6 to 8vishnu1$number of wet diapers for 4 to 5 days old:Average wet diapers per day: 6 to 8
As the baby grows and their intake increases, the number of wet diapers also increases. By around 4 to 5 days old, a healthy baby should have about 6 to 8 wet diapers per day. This indicates that they are adequately hydrated.
number of wet diapers for 1 to 2 months: Average wet diapers per day: 4 to 6vishnu1$number of wet diapers for 1 to 2 months: Average wet diapers per day: 4 to 6
As the baby continues to grow, their bladder capacity increases, and they may have fewer wet diapers compared to the earlier weeks. Generally, a baby between 1 to 2 months old should have around 4 to 6 wet diapers per day.vishnu1$It's important to note that these are average numbers, and the actual frequency of wet diapers can vary from baby to baby. Some babies may have slightly more or fewer wet diapers, which can still be considered within the normal range. It's essential to look for consistent wetting and consult with a healthcare professional if you have concerns.

Few reasons as to why salt and sugar should be avoided in a baby’s food:vishnu1$Few reasons as to why salt and sugar should be avoided in a baby’s food:
Too much salt intake damages kidney functions as the baby’s kidneys are unable to process & remove high salt levels from the baby’s blood. This creates pressure on the kidneys and causes kidney diseases later in life.
Too much sodium from salt also causes the baby’s body to excrete more calcium in the urine and this calcium can form kidney stones.

Nose correction in babies typically refers to corrective procedures performed to address congenital or acquired nasal deformities or functional issues in infants. It's important to note that any medical procedures or interventions should always be discussed with and performed by qualified medical professionals. Here are a few common scenarios where nose correction may be considered in babies:vishnu1$Nasal Fractures: In some cases, babies may experience nasal fractures during childbirth or due to accidental trauma. If a nasal fracture is suspected, a healthcare provider, such as a pediatrician or pediatric otolaryngologist, should be consulted. They can assess the severity of the fracture and determine if any intervention or correction is necessary.vishnu1$Nasal Obstruction: Some babies may have nasal obstruction due to structural abnormalities, such as choanal atresia (a blockage in the nasal passage), nasal polyps, or enlarged adenoids. These conditions can cause difficulty breathing through the nose and may require surgical correction or other appropriate treatments. Consultation with a pediatric specialist is essential for diagnosis and management.vishnu1$Cleft Lip and Palate: Babies born with a cleft lip or palate may require surgical correction of the nasal deformity associated with the condition. Cleft lip and palate surgeries aim to repair the separation of the lip or palate and restore a more normal appearance and function to the nose and surrounding structures. These procedures are typically performed by a pediatric plastic surgeon or a specialized craniofacial team.vishnu1$It's important to note that the specific approach to nose correction in babies will depend on the individual case, the underlying condition, and the recommendations of the medical professionals involved. Treatment plans may include a combination of medical management, non-surgical interventions, or surgical procedures, depending on the severity and nature of the nasal issue.vishnu1$If you have concerns about your baby's nasal appearance or suspect a functional problem, it's recommended to consult with your pediatrician or seek a referral to a specialist, such as a pediatric otolaryngologist or pediatric plastic surgeon, who can evaluate the situation and provide appropriate guidance and treatment options.vishnu1$Nose correction in babies, also known as nasal surgery or rhinoplasty, is a surgical procedure performed to address structural or functional issues with a baby's nose.

Burping your baby:
Winding, or burping your baby, is an important part of feeding. When your baby swallows, air bubbles can become trapped in their tummy and cause a lot of discomfort. Some babies find it easy to burp, while others need a helping hand.
When should I burp my baby?vishnu1$When should I burp my baby?
There are no rules on when you should burp your baby, some babies need burping during their feed, some after. Look for clues – if your baby seems uncomfortable while feeding, have a little burping break. If they seem fine while feeding, wait until they've finished. Your baby will let you know!
Your baby may bring some milk up while burping, so have a burp cloth or muslin square ready (this is perfectly normal and nothing to worry about).

What causes spitting up?vishnu1$What causes spitting up?
Spitting up is common in healthy babies. During their first three months, about half of all babies experience their stomach contents coming back up into the esophagus, a condition known as gastroesophageal reflux, infant reflux or infant acid reflux. Normally, a muscle between the esophagus and the stomach (lower esophageal sphincter) keeps stomach contents where they belong. Until this muscle has time to mature, spitting up might be an issue — especially if your baby is relatively full.
What is the difference between spitting up and vomiting?vishnu1$What is the difference between spitting up and vomiting?
Spitting up is the easy flow of a baby's stomach contents through his or her mouth, possibly with a burp. Vomiting occurs when the flow is forceful — shooting out inches rather than dribbling from the mouth.

Normal spitting up doesn't interfere with a baby's well-being. As long as your baby seems comfortable and is eating well and gaining weight, there's little cause for concern. If your baby is gaining weight, then he or she isn't being harmed by the calories lost through spitting up.Keep in mind that it's easy to overestimate the amount your baby has spit up based on the size of a spit-up stain.

Keep your baby upright. Feed your baby in a more upright position. Follow each feeding with 30 minutes in an upright position. Avoid immediate active play or use of an infant swing.
Avoid overfeeding. Feeding your baby smaller amounts, more frequently might help.
Take time to burp your baby. Frequent burps during and after each feeding can keep air from building up in your baby's stomach.vishnu1$Take time to burp your baby. Frequent burps during and after each feeding can keep air from building up in your baby's stomach.

****************************** Bloating **********************************vishnu1$****************************** Bloating **********************************
On average, babies pass gas about 13 to 21 times every day. A bloated baby belly due to gas is therefore quite common and usually doesn’t require any special treatments. Gas is particularly common in infants between one and four months, as their digestive systems are still developing. Read on to learn more about infant gas relief and effective ways to relieve gas.
Why do babies get bloated bellies?vishnu1$Why do babies get bloated bellies?
Many things can result in a gassy baby. Infants often swallow air when they’re crying, sucking a pacifier, and eating (whether milk comes from a bottle or a breast).Babies can become gassy if they swallow excessive air in the wrong feeding position, if they eat too much, or if they’re constipated. Newborn babies may also have allergies or intolerances to ingredients in formula or breast milk, leading to gas. Furthermore, infants’ digestive systems are still developing and learning to effectively process food, stool, and gas.

Effective positions to relieve gas:
One of the ways to relieve infant gas is to try holding your baby in different positions. Burping babies helps remove some of the air that babies swallow when eating. Try to use different positions while burping that feel comfortable for both of you. Try one of these three positions to relieve gas:vishnu1$Sit upright and hold your infant against your chest. In this position, your baby’s chin will be on your shoulder while you support them with your hand. Gently pat your baby on the back.
Hold your infant sitting up across your knee or in your lap. In this position, you will be gently supporting your baby’s head and chest by holding their chin. With the heel of your hand on your baby’s chest, be careful to hold your baby’s chin and not their throat. With your other hand, pat your baby’s back gently.vishnu1$Lay your baby face down on your lap. In this position, support your baby’s head and ensure that it’s higher than their chest. Pat their back gently.
Gas can affect both bottle-fed and breastfed babies equally. A frequently gassy baby is usually no cause for concern and quite normal. You can follow certain tips to help relieve your infant’s gas and make them feel better. 
1. Change your equipmentvishnu1$1. Change your equipment
If your baby is gassy from bottle-feeding, it might help to try a different kind of nipple and bottle combination. Soft nipples, which contour along your baby’s lips and mouth, can help prevent the accident flow of excess air when your baby is drinking.
Furthermore, the milk should be able to flow slowly and gradually so the baby has enough time to drink without gulping it excessively. While bottle-feeding, it’s best for babies to take between 20 minutes and one hour to finish eating.vishnu1$If they finish in five minutes, they are gulping too quickly and swallowing excess air. In cases like these, the nipple flow is probably too large for their age. Try switching to a nipple with a slower flow. 
2. Adjust the feeding position

While bottle-feeding or nursing your infant, adjust their feeding position to prevent a bloated baby belly. Keep their head higher than their stomach.
This position helps the milk move to the bottom of the stomach and the air to the top, which helps the baby burp. You can also use a nursing pillow to provide support and tip the nursing bottle slightly up so that there are no air bubbles in the nipple. 
3. Burp your babyvishnu1$3. Burp your baby
One of the best ways to provide gas relief is to burp your baby as they nurse and after. Instead of burping them while they are feeding, though, wait for them to take a break or slow down.
Otherwise, they may get upset, cry, and swallow more air in the process. Use the burping position that is most comfortable for them.  
Massage might also be helpful in relieving gas in your baby.
4. Be careful about foodsvishnu1$Massage might also be helpful in relieving gas in your baby.
4. Be careful about foods
To provide your infant with gas relief, talk to their doctor about foods that may cause extra gas. Some fruit juices contain sorbitols or sugar alcohols that babies can’t absorb, causing gas. The doctor will also make sure your baby is getting all the essential nutrients they need. 
If you are breastfeeding, foods you’ve eaten can also cause your baby to be gassy. If you give your baby formula, you can try switching brands. Some brands claim to prevent gas.

Swallowing airvishnu1$Reasons a baby may become gassy include:
Swallowing air
Babies can swallow air if they latch onto the breast incorrectly, or if they nurse or drink from a bottle in certain positions. They can even swallow air just from babbling a lot.
Excessive crying

Prevention
Some strategies that may help prevent gas include:
Changing the feeding position: Try changing the baby’s position while they eat to ensure their head is slightly above their belly.
Improving latch: Sometimes a weak latch causes a baby to swallow too much air. A person can talk with a lactation consultant if breastfeeding is painful, the baby seems frustrated, or the baby frequently unlatches from the breast. Going to a La Leche League meeting can also help.vishnu1$Slowing down feeding: Slowing down the rate at which formula-fed babies eat may help. Some babies drink bottles very quickly, causing them to swallow air. Try using a slow-flow nipple. People can find various brands online.
Trying different bottles: Some babies get less gas when using different-shaped bottles, such as curved bottles. Regardless of the type of bottle, it is important to hold it up enough so that the base of the bottle is full of milk rather than air.vishnu1$Burping the baby more often: A person can try taking a break in the middle of each feed to burp the baby.

Risk factors for colic are not well-understood. Research has not shown differences in risk when the following factors were considered:
Sex of the child
Preterm and full-term pregnancies
Formula-fed and breast-fed babiesvishnu1$Sex of the child
Preterm and full-term pregnancies
Formula-fed and breast-fed babies
Infants born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy or after delivery have an increased risk of developing colic.
Complications
Colic does not cause short-term or long-term medical problems for a child.
Colic is stressful for parents. Research has shown an association between colic and the following problems with parent well-being:
Increased risk of postpartum depression in mothers
Early cessation of breast-feeding
Feelings of guilt, exhaustion, helplessness or anger
Shaken baby syndromevishnu1$Increased risk of postpartum depression in mothers
Early cessation of breast-feeding
Feelings of guilt, exhaustion, helplessness or anger
Shaken baby syndrome
The stress of calming a crying baby has sometimes prompted parents to shake or otherwise harm their child. Shaking a baby can cause serious damage to the brain and death. The risk of these uncontrolled reactions is greater if parents don't have information about soothing a crying child, education about colic and the support needed for caring for an infant with colic.
11 Common Conditions in Newbornsvishnu1$11 Common Conditions in Newborns
Some physical conditions are common during the first couple of weeks after birth. If you notice any of the following in your baby, contact your pediatrician.​​
Abdominal distension:vishnu1$Some physical conditions are common during the first couple of weeks after birth. If you notice any of the following in your baby, contact your pediatrician.​​
Abdominal distension:
Most babies' bellies normally stick out, especially after a large feeding. Between feedings, however, they should feel soft. If your child's abdomen feels swollen and hard, and if she has not had a bowel movement for more than one or two days or is vomiting, call your pediatrician. Most likely the problem is due to gas or constipation, but it also could signal a more serious intestinal problem.
Birth injuries:vishnu1$Babies can be injured during birth, especially if labor is long or difficult, or when babies are very large. While newborns recover quickly from some of these injuries, others persist. Occasionally a broken collarbone occurs, which will heal quickly. After a few weeks a small lump may form at the fracture site, but don't be alarmed; this is a sign that new bone is forming to mend the injury, and it will soon be as good as new.Muscle weakness is another common birth injury during labor, caused by pressure or stretching of the nerves attached to the muscles. These muscles, usually weakened on one side of the face or one shoulder or arm, generally re­turn to normal after several weeks. In the meantime, ask your pediatrician to show you how to nurse and hold the baby to promote healing.vishnu1$Blue baby:
Babies may have mildly blue or purple hands and feet, which is usually normal. If their hands and feet turn slightly blue from cold, they should return to pink as soon as they are warm. Occasionally the face, tongue, and lips may turn a little blue when the newborn is crying hard, but once she is calm, her color should quickly return to normal. However, persistently blue skin coloring is a sign the heart or lungs are not operating properly. and the baby is not getting enough oxygen in the blood. Immediate medical attention is essential.
Unusual bowel movements:vishnu1$Meconium. After birth, the staff will watch for your baby's first urination and bowel movement to make sure she has no problem with these important tasks. It may be delayed twenty-four hours or more. The first bowel movement or two will be black or dark green and very slimy. It is meconium, a substance that fills the infant's intestines before she is born. If your baby does not pass meconium in the first forty-eight hours, further evaluation is required to make sure that no problems exist in the lower bowel.Blood in stool. On occasion, newborns have a little blood in their bowel movements. If it occurs during the first few days, it usually means the infant has a little crack in the anus from stooling. This is generally harmless, but even so, let your pediatrician know about any signs of blood to confirm the reason, since there are other causes that require further evaluation and treatment.vishnu1$Coughing:
If the baby drinks very fast, she may cough and sputter; but this type of coughing should stop as soon as her feeding routine becomes familiar. This may also be related to how strongly or fast a breastfeeding mom's milk comes down. If she coughs persistently or routinely gags during feedings, consult the pediatrician. These symptoms could indicate an underlying problem in the lungs or digestive tract.
Excessive crying:vishnu1$All newborns cry, often for no apparent reason. If you've made sure that your baby is fed, burped, warm, and dressed in a clean diaper, the best tactic is probably to hold her and talk or sing to her until she stops. You cannot spoil a baby this age by giving her too much attention. If this doesn't work, wrap her snugly in a blanket or try some other ways that may help calm your baby.You'll become accustomed to your baby's patterns of crying. If it ever sounds peculiar—such as shrieks of pain—or if it persists for an unusual length of time, it could mean a medical problem. Call the pediatrician and ask for advice.vishnu1$Forceps marks:
When forceps are used during delivery, they can leave red marks or even superficial scrapes on a newborn's face and head. These generally disappear within a few days. Sometimes a firm, flat lump develops in one of these areas because of minor damage to the tissue under the skin, but this, too, will usually go away within two months.
​Jaundice:vishnu1$Many normal, healthy newborns have a yellowish tinge to their skin, which is known as jaundice. It is caused by a buildup of bilirubin in the child's blood. Mild jaundice is harmless. However, if the bilirubin level continues to rise and is not treated, it can lead to brain injury. Jaundice tends to be more common in breastfed newborns, most often in those not nursing well; breastfeeding mothers should nurse at least eight to twelve times per day, which will produce enough milk and keep bilirubin levels low.Jaundice first appears on the face, then the chest and abdomen, and finally the arms and legs in some instances. The whites of the eyes may also be yellow. Most hospitals now routinely screen newborns for jaundice twenty-four hours after birth using a painless handheld light meter. If the pediatrician suspects jaundice may be present—based on skin color as well as the baby's age and other factors—she may order a skin or blood test to definitively diagnose the condition. If jaundice develops before the baby is twenty-four hours old, a bil­irubin test is always needed to make an accurate diagnosis. If you notice a sudden increase in jaundice when your baby is at home, contact your pediatri­cian.vishnu1$Lethargy & sleepiness:
Every newborn spends most of her time sleeping. As long as she wakes every few hours, eats well, seems content, and is alert part of the day, it's perfectly normal to sleep the rest of the time. But if she's rarely alert, does not wake up on her own for feedings, or seems too tired or uninterested to eat, you should consult your pediatrician. This lethargy—especially if it's a sudden change in her usual pattern—may be a symptom of a serious illness.
Respiratory distress:vishnu1$Respiratory distress:
It may take your baby a few hours after birth to form a normal breathing pattern, but then she should have no further difficulties. If she seems to be breathing in an unusual manner, it is most often due to blocked nasal passages. Using saline nasal drops, followed by suctioning the mucus from the nose with a bulb syringe, may fix the problem; both are available over the counter.However, if your newborn shows any of the following warning signs, no­tify your pediatrician immediately:vishnu1$Fast breathing (more than sixty breaths in one minute), although keep in mind that babies normally breathe more rapidly than adults
Retractions (sucking in the muscles between the ribs with each breath, so that her ribs stick out)
Flaring of her nose
Grunting while breathing
Persistent blue skin coloring
Umbilical cord problems:vishnu1$Flaring of her nose

Umbilical cord problems:
Umbilical stump bleeding. As you're caring for your baby's umbilical cord, you may notice a few drops of blood on the diaper around the time the stump falls off. This is normal. But if the cord actively bleeds, call your baby's doctor immediately. If the stump becomes infected, it will require medical treatment. Although cord infections are uncommon, you should contact your doctor if you notice any of the following:
Foul-smelling yellowish discharge from the cordvishnu1$Foul-smelling yellowish discharge from the cord
Red skin around the base of the cord
Crying when you touch the cord or the skin next to it
Umbilical granuloma. Sometimes instead of completely drying, the cord will form a granuloma or a small, reddened mass of scar tissue that stays on the belly button after the umbilical cord has fallen off. This granuloma will drain a light-yellowish fluid. This condition will usually go away in about a week, but if not, your pediatrician may need to burn off (cauterize) the granulomatous tissue.vishnu1$Umbilical hernia. If your baby's umbilical cord area seems to push outward when she cries, she may have an umbilical hernia—a small hole in the muscular part of the abdominal wall that allows the tissue to bulge out when there is increased abdominal pressure (i.e., crying). This is not a serious condition, and it usually heals by itself in the first twelve to eighteen months. (For unknown reasons it often takes longer to heal in African American babies.) In the unlikely event it doesn't heal by three to five years of age, the hole may need surgery. Don't put tape or a coin on the navel. It will not help the hernia, and it may cause a skin rash.
